<h1>My Wonderful Visit</h1>

<h2 class="chap1">I.<br />
<br />
I DECIDE TO PLAY HOOKEY</h2>

<p class="p2">A steak-and-kidney pie, influenza,
and a cablegram. There is the triple
alliance that is responsible for the whole thing.
Though there might have been a bit of homesickness
and a desire for applause mixed up in the
cycle of circumstances that started me off to Europe
for a vacation.</p>

<p>For seven years I had been basking in California's
perpetual sunlight, a sunlight artificially
enhanced by the studio Cooper-Hewitts. For
seven years I had been working and thinking
along in a single channel and I wanted to get away.
Away from Hollywood, the cinema colony, away
from scenarios, away from the celluloid smell of the
studios, away from contracts, press notices, cutting
rooms, crowds, bathing beauties, custard pies, big
shoes, and little moustaches. I was in the atmosphere
of achievement, but an achievement which,
to me, was rapidly verging on stagnation.</p>

<p>I wanted an emotional holiday. Perhaps I am
projecting at the start a difficult condition for conception,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
but I assure you that even the clown has
his rational moments and I needed a few.</p>

<p>The triple alliance listed above came about
rather simultaneously. I had finished the picture
of "The Kid" and "The Idle Class" and was
about to embark on another. The company had
been engaged. Script and settings were ready.
We had worked on the picture one day.</p>

<p>I was feeling very tired, weak, and depressed.
I had just recovered from an attack of influenza.
I was in one of those "what's the use" moods.
I wanted something and didn't know what it was.</p>

<p>And then Montague Glass invited me to dinner
at his home in Pasadena. There were many other
invitations, but this one carried with it the
assurance that there would be a steak-and-kidney
pie. A weakness of mine. I was on hand ahead
of time. The pie was a symphony. So was the
evening. Monty Glass, his charming wife, their
little daughter, Lucius Hitchcock, the illustrator,
and his wife&mdash;just a homey little family party
devoid of red lights and jazz orchestras. It awoke
within me a chord of something reminiscent. I
couldn't quite tell what.</p>

<p>After the final onslaught on the pie, into the
parlour before an open fire. Conversation, not
studio patois nor idle chatter. An exchange of
ideas&mdash;ideas founded on ideas. I discovered that
Montague Glass was much more than the author
of <i>Potash and Perlmutter</i>. He thought. He was
an accomplished musician.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span></p>

<p>He played the piano. I sang. Not as an
exponent of entertainment, but as part of the group
having a pleasant, homey evening. We played
charades. The evening was over too soon. It
left me wishing. Here was home in its true sense.
Here was a man artistically and commercially
successful who still managed to lock the doors and
put out the cat at night.</p>

<p>I drove back to Los Angeles. I was restless.
There was a cablegram waiting for me from
London. It called attention to the fact that my
latest picture, "The Kid," was about to make
its appearance in London, and, as it had been
acclaimed my best, this was the time for me to
make the trip back to my native land. A trip that
I had been promising myself for years.</p>

<p>What would Europe look like after the war?</p>

<p>I thought it over. I had never been present at
the first showing of one of my pictures. Their
début to me had been in Los Angeles projection
rooms. I had been missing something vital and
stimulating. I had success, but it was stored away
somewhere. I had never opened the package and
tasted it. I sort of wanted to be patted on the
back. And I rather relished the pats coming in
and from England. They had hinted that I could,
so I wanted to turn London upside down. Who
wouldn't want to do that? And all the time there
was the spectre of nervous breakdown from overwork
threatening and the results of influenza apparent,
to say nothing of the steak-and-kidney pie.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span></p>

<p>Sensation of the pleasantest sort beckoned me,
at the same time rest was promised. I wanted to
grab it while it was good. Perhaps "The Kid"
might be my last picture. Maybe there would
never be another chance for me to bask in the spotlight.
And I wanted to see Europe&mdash;England,
France, Germany, and Russia. Europe was new.</p>

<p>It was too much. I stopped preparations on the
picture we were taking. Decided to leave the next
night for Europe. And did it despite the protests
and the impossibility howlers. Tickets were
taken. We packed; everyone was shocked. I
was glad of it. I wanted to shock everyone.</p>

<p>The next night I believe that most of Hollywood
was at the train in Los Angeles to see me off.
And so were their sisters and their cousins and their
aunts. Why was I going? A secret mission, I
told them. It was an effective answer. I was
immediately under contract to do pictures in Europe
in the minds of most of them. But then, would
they have believed or understood if I had told them
I wanted an emotional holiday? I don't believe so.</p>

<p>There was the usual station demonstration
at the train. The crowd rather surprised me. It
was but a foretaste. I do not try to remember the
shouted messages of cheer that were flung at me.
They were of the usual sort, I imagine. One,
however, sticks. My brother Syd at the last
moment rushed up to one of my party.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, don't let him get married!"
he shouted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span></p>

<p>It gave the crowd a laugh and me a scare.</p>

<p>The train pulled out and I settled down to three
days of relaxation and train routine. I ate sometimes
in the dining car, sometimes in our drawing-room.
I slept atrociously. I always do. I hate
travelling. The faces left on the platform at Los
Angeles began to look kinder and more attractive.
They did not seem the sort to drive one away. But
they had, or maybe it was optical illusion on my
part, illusion fostered by mental unrest.</p>

<p>For two thousand miles we did the same thing
over many times, then repeated it. Perhaps there
were many interesting people on the train. I did
not find out. The percentage of interesting ones
on trains is too small to hazard. Most of the time
we played solitaire. You can play it many times
in two thousand miles.</p>

<p>Then we reached Chicago. I like Chicago,
I have never been there for any great length of
time, but my glimpses of it have disclosed tremendous
activity. Its record speaks achievement.</p>

<p>But to me, personally, Chicago suggested Carl
Sandburg, whose poetry I appreciate highly and
whom I had met in Los Angeles. I must see dear
old Carl and also call at the office of the <i>Daily News</i>.
They were running an enormous scenario contest.
I am one of the judges, and it happens that Carl
Sandburg is on the same paper.</p>

<p>Our party went to the Blackstone Hotel, where
a suite had been placed at our disposal. The hotel
management overwhelmed us with courtesies.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span></p>

<p>Then came the reporters. You can't describe
them unless you label them with the hackneyed
interrogation point.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chaplin, why are you going to
Europe?"</p>

<p>"Just for a vacation."</p>

<p>"Are you going to make pictures while you are
there?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"What do you do with your old moustaches?"</p>

<p>"Throw them away."</p>

<p>"What do you do with your old canes?"</p>

<p>"Throw them away."</p>

<p>"What do you do with your old shoes?"</p>

<p>"Throw them away."</p>

<p>That lad did well. He got in all those questions
before he was shouldered aside and two black eyes
boring through lenses surrounded by tortoise-shell
frames claimed an innings. I restored the "prop
grin" which I had decided was effective for
interviews.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chaplin, have you your cane and shoes
with you?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I don't think I'll need them."</p>

<p>"Are you going to get married while you are in
Europe?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_014" id="i_014"></a>
<img src="images/i_014.png" width="430" height="514" alt="" />
<p class="caption">THE CALIFORNIAN SEA LION<br />
THE ORIGIN OF THE FAMOUS BOOTS REVEALED AT LAST.<br />
(<i>One of my favourite cartoons.</i>)</p>
</div>
<p>The bespectacled one passed with the tide. As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
he passed I let the grin slip away, but only for a
moment. Hastily I recalled it as a charming
young lady caught me by the arm.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chaplin, do you ever expect to get
married?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"To whom?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Do you want to play 'Hamlet'?"</p>

<p>"Why, I don't know. I haven't thought much
about it, but if you think there are any reasons
why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But she was gone. Another district attorney
had the floor.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chaplin, are you a Bolshevik?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Then why are you going to Europe?"</p>

<p>"For a holiday."</p>

<p>"What holiday?"</p>

<p>"Pardon me, folks, but I did not sleep well on
the train and I must go to bed."</p>

<p>Like a football player picking a hole in the line,
I had seen the bedroom door open and a friendly
hand beckon. I made for it. Within I had every
opportunity to anticipate the terror that awaited me
on my holiday. Not the crowds. I love them.
They are friendly and instantaneous. But interviewers!
Then we went to the <i>News</i> office, and
the trip was accomplished without casualty.
There we met photographers. I didn't relish
facing them. I hate still pictures.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span></p>

<p>But it had to be done. I was the judge in
the contest and they must have pictures of the
judge.</p>

<p>Now I had always pictured a judge as being a
rather dignified personage, but I learned about
judges from them. Their idea of the way to photograph
a judge was to have him standing on his head
or with one leg pointing east. They suggested a
moustache, a Derby hat, and a cane.</p>

<p>It was inevitable.</p>

<p>I couldn't get away from Chaplin.</p>

<p>And I did so want a holiday.</p>

<p>But I met Carl Sandburg. There was an oasis
amid the misery. Good old Carl! We recalled
the days in Los Angeles. It was a most pleasant
chat.</p>

<p>Back to the hotel.</p>

<p>Reporters. More reporters. Lady reporters.</p>

<p>A publicity barrage.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chaplin&mdash;"</p>

<p>But I escaped. What a handy bedroom!
There must be something in practice. I felt that
I negotiated it much better on the second attempt.
I rather wanted to try out my theory to see if I
had become an adept in dodging into the bedroom.
I would try it. I went out to brave the reporters.
But they were gone. And when I ducked back
into the bedroom, as a sort of rehearsal, it fell flat.
The effect was lost without the cause.</p>

<p>A bit of food, some packing, and then to the
train again. This time for New York. Crowds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
again. I liked them. Cameras. I did not mind
them this time, as I was not asked to pose.</p>

<p>Carl was there to see me off.</p>

<p>I must do or say something extra nice to him.
Something he could appreciate. I couldn't think.
I talked inanities and I felt that he knew I was being
inane. I tried to think of a passage of his poetry
to recite. I couldn't. Then it came&mdash;the
inspiration.</p>

<p>"Where can I buy your book of poems, Carl?"
I almost blurted it out. It was gone. Too late to
be recalled.</p>

<p>"At any bookstore."</p>

<p>His reply may have been casual. To me it was
damning.</p>

<p>Ye gods, what a silly imbecile I was! I needed
rest. My brain was gone. I couldn't think of a
thing to say in reprieve. Thank God, the train
pulled out then. I hope Carl will understand and
forgive when he reads this, if he ever does.</p>

<p>A wretched sleep <i>en train</i>, more solitaire, meals
at schedule times, and then we hit New York.</p>

<p>Crowds. Reporters. Photographers. And
Douglas Fairbanks. Good old Doug. He did
his best, but Doug has never had a picture yet
where he had to buck news photographers. They
snapped me in every posture anatomically possible.
Two of them battled with my carcass in
argument over my facing east or west.</p>

<p>Neither won. But I lost. My body couldn't
be split. But my clothes could&mdash;and were.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p>But Doug put in a good lick and got me into an
automobile. Panting, I lay back against the
cushions.</p>

<p>To the Ritz went Doug and I.</p>

<p>To the Ritz went the crowd.</p>

<p>Or at least I thought so, for there was a crowd
there and it looked like the same one. I almost
imagined I saw familiar faces. Certainly I saw
cameras. But this time our charge was most successful.
With a guard of porters as shock troops,
we negotiated the distance between the curb and
the lobby without the loss of a single button.</p>

<p>I felt rather smart and relieved. But, as usual,
I was too previous. We ascended to the suite.
There they were. The gentlemen of the press.
And one lady of the press.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chaplin, why are you going to Europe?"</p>

<p>"For a vacation."</p>

<p>"What do you do with your old moustaches?"</p>

<p>"Throw them away."</p>

<p>"Do you ever expect to get married?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What's her name?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Are you a Bolshevik?"</p>

<p>"I am an artist. I am interested in life. Bolshevism
is a new phase of life. I must be interested
in it."</p>

<p>"Do you want to play 'Hamlet'?"</p>

<p>"Why, I don't know&mdash;"</p>

<p>Again Lady Luck flew to my side. I was called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
to the telephone. I answered the one in my bedroom,
and closed the door, and kept it closed. The
Press departed. I felt like a wrung dish-rag. I
looked into the mirror. I saw a Cheshire cat
grinning back at me. I was still carrying the
"prop" grin that I had invented for interviews.
I wondered if it would be easier to hold it all the
time rather than chase it into play at the sight of
reporters. But some one might accuse me of
imitating Doug. So I let the old face slip back to
normal.</p>

<p>Doug came. Mary was better. She was with
him. It was good to see her. The three of us
went to the roof to be photographed. We were,
in every conceivable pose until some one suggested
that Doug should hang over the edge of the roof,
holding Mary in one hand and me in the other.
Pretty little thought. But that's as far as it got.
I beat Doug to the refusal by a hair.</p>

<p>It's great to have friends like Doug and Mary.
They understood me perfectly. They knew what
the seven years' grind had meant to my nerves.
They knew just how badly I needed this vacation,
how I needed to get away from studios and pictures,
how I needed to get away from myself.</p>

<p>Doug had thought it all out and had planned
that while I was in New York my vacation should
be perfect. He would see that things were kept
pleasant for me.</p>

<p>So he insisted that I should go and see his new
picture, "The Three Musketeers."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<p>I was nettled. I didn't want to see pictures.
But I was polite. I did not refuse, though I did try
to evade.</p>

<p>It was useless. Very seriously he wanted me
to see the picture and give my honest opinion. He
wanted my criticism, my suggestions.</p>

<p>I had to do it. I always do. I saw the picture
in jerks.</p>

<p>Reporters were there. Their attendance was
no secret.</p>

<p>The picture over, I suggested a few changes and
several cuts which I thought would improve it.</p>

<p>I always do.</p>

<p>They listened politely and then let the picture
ride the way it was.</p>

<p>They always do.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the changes I suggested were not
made, and the picture is a tremendous success.</p>

<p>But I still have status as a critic. I am invited
to a showing of Mary's picture, "Little Lord
Fauntleroy," and asked for suggestions. They
know that I'll criticise. I always do and they are
afraid of me. Though when they look at my pictures
they are always kind and sympathetic and
never criticise.</p>

<p>I told Mary her picture was too long. I told
her where to cut it. Which, of course, she doesn't
do. She never does.</p>

<p>She and Doug listen politely and the picture
stands. It always does.</p>

<p>Newspaper men are at the hotel. I go through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
the same barrage of questions. My "prop"
grin does duty for fifteen minutes. I escape.</p>

<p>Douglas 'phones me. He wants to be nice to
me. I am on my vacation and he wants it to be a
very pleasant one. So he invites me to see "The
Three Musketeers" again. This time at its first
showing before the public.</p>

<p>Before the opening of Doug's picture we were
to have dinner together, Mary and Doug, Mrs.
Condé Nast and I.</p>

<p>I felt very embarrassed at meeting Mrs. Nast
again. Somewhere there lurks in my memory a
broken dinner engagement. It worried me, as I
had not even written. It was so foolish not to
write. I would be met probably with an "all-is-forgiven"
look.</p>

<p>I decide that my best defence is to act vague
and not speak of it. I do so and get away with it.</p>

<p>And she has the good taste not to mention it,
so a pleasant time is had by all.</p>

<p>We went to the theatre in Mrs. Nast's beautiful
limousine. The crowds were gathered for several
blocks on every side of the theatre.</p>

<p>I felt proud that I was in the movies. Though
on this night, with Douglas and Mary, I felt that
I was trailing in their glory. It was their night.</p>

<p>There are cheers&mdash;for Mary, for Doug, for me.
Again I feel proud that I am in the movies. I try
to look dignified. I coax up the "prop" smile
and put into it real pleasure. It is a real smile. It
feels good and natural.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span></p>

<p>We get out of the car and crowds swarm. Most
of the "all-American" selections are there.
Doug takes Mary under his wing and ploughs
through as though he were doing a scene and the
crowd were extras.</p>

<p>I took my cue from him. I took Mrs. Nast's
arm. At least I tried to take it, but she seemed to
sort of drift away from me down towards Eighth
Avenue, while I, for no apparent reason, backed
toward Broadway. The tide changed. I was
swept back toward the entrance of the theatre. I
was not feeling so proud as I had been. I was still
smiling at the dear public, but it had gone back to
the "prop" smile.</p>

<p>I realised this and tried to put real pleasure into
the smile again. As the grin broadened it opened
new space and a policeman parked his fist in it.</p>

<p>I don't like the taste of policemen's fists. I told
him so. He glared at me and pushed me for a
"first down." My hat flew toward the heavens.
It has never returned to me.</p>

<p>I felt a draught. I heard machinery. I looked
down. A woman with a pair of scissors was snipping
a piece from the seat of my trousers. Another
grabbed my tie and almost put an end to my suffering
through strangulation. My collar was next.
But they only got half of that.</p>

<p>My shirt was pulled out. The buttons torn from
my vest. My feet trampled on. My face scratched.
But I still retained the smile, "prop" one though
it was. Whenever I could think of it I tried to raise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
it above the level of a "prop" smile and was
always rewarded with a policeman's fist. I kept
insisting that I was Charlie Chaplin and that I
belonged inside. It was absolutely necessary that
I should see "The Three Musketeers."</p>

<p>Insistence won. As though on a prearranged
signal I felt myself lifted from my feet, my body
inverted until my head pointed toward the centre of
the lobby and my feet pointed toward an electric
sign advertising the Ziegfeld Roof. Then there
was a surge, and I moved forward right over the
heads of the crowd through the lobby.</p>

<p>As I went through the door, not knowing into
what, I saw a friend.</p>

<p>With the "prop" smile still waving, I flung
back, "See you later," and, head first, I entered
the theatre and came to in a heap at the foot of a
bediamonded dowager. I looked up, still carrying
the "prop" smile, but my effort fell flat. There
was no applause in the look she gave me.</p>

<p>Crestfallen, I gathered myself together, and with
what dignity there was left I strode to the box that
had been set aside for our party. There was Mary,
as sweet and beautiful as ever; Mrs. Nast, calm
and composed: Doug serene and dapper.</p>

<p>"Late again," they looked.</p>

<p>And Mary, steely polite, enumerated my sartorial
shortcomings. But I knew one of them, at
least better than she did, and I hastened to the
men's room for repairs. Soap and water and a
brush did wonders, but I could find no trousers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
collar, or tie, and I returned clean but ragged to the
box, where disapproval was being registered
unanimously.</p>

<p>I tried to make the "prop" grin more radiant,
even though I was most tired after my journey, but
it didn't go with Doug and Mary.</p>

<p>But I refused to let them spoil my pleasure and
I saw "The Three Musketeers."</p>

<p>It was a thrilling success for Doug. I felt good
for him, though I was a bit envious. I wondered
if the showing of "The Kid" could have meant as
big a night for me.</p>

<p>'Twas quite a night, this opening of the Fairbanks
masterpiece, and, considering all the circumstances,
I think I behaved admirably. Somehow,
though, I think there is a vote of three to one
against me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>

<h2>II.<br />
<br />
OFF TO EUROPE</h2>

<p class="p2">Next morning there was work to do. My
lawyer, Nathan Burkan, had to be seen.
There were contracts and other things. Almost as
much a nuisance as interviews. But I dare say they
are necessary.</p>

<p>Poor old Nath! I love him, but am afraid of
him. His pockets always bulge contracts. We
could be such good friends if he were not a lawyer.
And I am sure that there must be times when he
is delightful company. I might fire him and then
get acquainted.</p>

<p>A very dull day with him. Interrupted by
'phones, invitations, parties, theatre tickets sent to
me, people asking for jobs. Hundreds of letters
camouflaged with good wishes and invariably asking
favours. But I like them.</p>

<p>Calls from many old friends who depress me and
many new ones who thrill me. I wanted some
buckwheat cakes. I had to go three blocks to a
Childs' restaurant to get them.</p>

<p>That night I went to see "Liliom," the best
play in New York at the time and one which in
moments rises to true greatness. It impressed me
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
tremendously and made me dissatisfied with myself.
I don't like being without work. I want to go on
the stage. Wonder if I could play that part?</p>

<p>I went back behind the scenes and met young
Skildkraut. I was amazed at his beauty and youth.
Truly an artist, sincere and simple. And Eva Le
Gallienne, I recall no one else on the stage just like
her. She is a charming artist. We renewed our
acquaintance made in Los Angeles.</p>

<p>The next morning provided a delightful treat.
Breakfast for me, luncheon for the others, at the
Coffee House Club, a most interesting little place
where artists and artizans belong&mdash;writers, actors,
musicians, sculptors, painters&mdash;all of them
interesting people. I go there often whenever I
am in New York. It was a brilliant party, Heywood
Broun, Frank Crowninshield, Harrison
Rhodes, Edward Knoblock, Condé Nast,
Alexander Woolcott&mdash;but I can't remember all the
names. I wish all meals were as pleasant.</p>

<p>I received an invitation to dine with Ambassador
Gerard and then go for a ride in the country. The
motor broke down, as they usually do on such occasions,
and I had to 'phone and disappoint. I was
sorry, because I was to meet some brilliant people.</p>

<p>I had luncheon next day with Max Eastman, one
of my best friends. He is a radical and a poet and
editor of <i>The Liberator</i>, a charming and sympathetic
fellow who thinks. All of his doctrines I do
not subscribe to, but that makes no difference in
our friendship. We get together, argue a bit, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
then agree to disagree and let it go at that and
remain friends.</p>

<p>He told me of a party that he was giving at his
home that evening and I hastened to accept his
invitation to attend. His home is always interesting.
His friends likewise.</p>

<p>What a night it was for me! I got out of myself.
My emotions went the gamut of tears to laughter
without artificiality. It was what I had left Los
Angeles for, and that night Charlie Chaplin seemed
very far away, and I felt or wanted to feel myself
just a simple soul among other souls.</p>

<p>I was introduced to George, an ex-I. W. W.
secretary. I suppose he has a last name, but I
didn't know it and it didn't seem to matter when
one met George. Here was a real personality. He
had a light in his eyes that I have never seen before,
a light that must have shone from his soul. He
had the look of one who believes he is right and
has the courage of his convictions. It is a scarce
article.</p>

<p>I learned that he had been sentenced by Judge
Landis to serve twenty year in the penitentiary,
that he had served two years and was out because
of ill-health. I did not learn the offence. It did
not seem to matter.</p>

<p>A dreamer and a poet, he became wistfully gay
on this hectic night among kindred spirits. In a
mixed crowd of intellectuals he stood out.</p>

<p>He was going back to serve his eighteen years in
the penitentiary and was remaining jovial. What an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
ordeal! But ordeal signifies what it would have
been for me. I don't believe it bothered him. I
hardly believe he was there. He was somewhere
else in the place from which that look in his eyes
emanated. A man whose ideas are ideals.</p>

<p>I pass no opinion, but with such charm one must
sympathise.</p>

<p>It was an amusing evening. We played charades
and I watched George act. It was all sorts of fun.
We danced a bit.</p>

<p>Then George came in imitating Woodrow. It
was screamingly funny, and he threw himself into
the character, or caricature, making Wilson seem
absurdly ridiculous. We were convulsed with
laughter.</p>

<p>But all the time I couldn't help thinking that
he must go back to the penitentiary for eighteen
years.</p>

<p>What a party!</p>

<p>It didn't break up until two in the morning,
though clock or calendar didn't get a thought from
me.</p>

<p>We all played, danced, and acted. No one asked
me to walk funny, no one asked me to twirl a cane.
If I wanted to do a tragic bit, I did, and so did
everyone else. You were a creature of the present,
not a production of the past, not a promise of the
future. You were accepted as is, <i>sans</i> "Who's
Who" labels and income-tax records.</p>

<p>George asks me about my trip, but he does not
interview. He gives me letters to friends.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span></p>

<p>In my puny way, sounding hollow and unconvincing,
I try to tell George how foolish he is. He
tries to explain that he can't help it. Like all trail
blazers, he is a martyr. He does not rant. He
blames no one. He does not rail at fate.</p>

<p>If he believes himself persecuted, his belief is
unspoken. He is almost Christlike as he explains
to me. His viewpoint is beautiful, kind, and
tender.</p>

<p>I can't imagine what he has done to be sentenced
to twenty years. My thought must speak.
He believes he is spoiling my party through making
me serious. He doesn't want that.</p>

<p>He stops talking about himself. Suddenly he
runs, grabs a woman's hat, and says, "Look,
Charlie, I'm Sarah Bernhardt!" and goes into a
most ridiculous travesty.</p>

<p>I laugh. Everyone laughs. George laughs.</p>

<p>And he is going back to the penitentiary to spend
eighteen of the most wonderful years of his life!</p>

<p>I can't stand it. I go out in the garden and gaze
up at the stars. It is a wonderful night and a
glorious moon is shining down. I wish there was
something I could do for George. I wonder if he
is right or wrong.</p>

<p>Before long George joins me. He is sad and
reflective, with a sadness of beauty, not of regret.
He looks at the moon, the stars. He confides,
how stupid is the party, any party, compared with
the loveliness of the night. The silence that is a
universal gift&mdash;how few of us enjoy it. Perhaps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
because it cannot be bought. Rich men buy noise.
Souls revel in nature's silences. They cannot be
denied those who seek them.</p>

<p>We talk of George's future. Not of his past nor
of his offence. Can't he escape? I try to make
him think logically toward regaining his freedom.
I want to pledge my help. He doesn't understand,
or pretends not to. He has not lost anything.
Bars cannot imprison his spirit.</p>

<p>I beg him to give himself and his life a better
chance.</p>

<p>He smiles.</p>

<p>"Don't bother about me, Charlie. You have
your work. Go on making the world laugh.
Yours is a great task and a splendid one. Don't
bother about me."</p>

<p>We are silent. I am choked up. I feel a sort
of pent-up helplessness. I want relief. It comes.</p>

<p>The tears roll down my cheeks and George
embraces me.</p>

<p>There are tears in both our eyes.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Charlie."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, George."</p>

<p>What a party! Its noise disgusts me now. I
call my car. I go back to the Ritz.</p>

<p>George goes back to the "pen."</p>

<p>Chuck Reisner, who played the big bully in
"The Kid," called the next day. He wants to go
to Europe. Why? He doesn't know. He is
emotional and sensational. He is a pugilist and a
song writer. A civil soldier of fortune. He doesn't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
like New York and thinks he wants to get back to
California at once.</p>

<p>We have breakfast together. It is a delightful
meal because it is so different from my usual lonely
breakfast. Chuck goes on at a great rate and succeeds
in working up his own emotions until there
are tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>I promise him all sorts of things to get rid of him.
He knows it and tells me so. We understand each
other very well. I promise him an engagement.
Tell him he can always get a job with me if he
doesn't want too much money.</p>

<p>He is indignant at some press notices that have
appeared about me and wants to go down to newspaper
row and kill a few reporters. He fathers,
mothers me in his rough way.</p>

<p>We talk about everybody's ingratitude for what
he and I have done for people. We have a mutual-admiration
convention. Why aren't we appreciated
more? We are both sour on the world and its
hypocrisies. It's a great little game panning the
world so long as you don't let your sessions get too
long or too serious.</p>

<p>I had a luncheon engagement at the Coffee
House Club with Frank Crowninshield, and we
talked over the arrangements of a dinner which I am
giving to a few intimate friends. Frank is my
social mentor, though I care little about society in
the general acceptance of the term. We arranged
for a table at the Elysée Café and it was to be a
mixed party.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></p>

<p>Among the guests were Max Eastman, Harrison
Rhodes, Edward Knoblock, Mme. Maeterlinck,
Alexander Woolcott, Douglas Fairbanks
and Mary, Heywood Broun, Rita Weiman, and
Neysa McMein, a most charming girl for whom I
am posing.</p>

<p>Frank Harris and Waldo Frank were invited,
but were unable to attend. Perhaps there were
others, but I can't remember, and I am sure they
will forgive me if I have neglected to mention them.
I am always confused about parties and arrangements.</p>

<p>The last minute sets me wild. I am a very bad
organiser. I am always leaving everything until
the last minute, and as a rule no one shows up.</p>

<p>This was the exception. For on this occasion
everybody did turn up. And it started off like
most parties; everybody was stiff and formal; I
felt a terrible failure as a host. But in spite of Mr.
Volstead there was a bit of "golden water" to be
had, and it saved the day. What a blessing at
times!</p>

<p>I had been worried since sending the invitations.
I wondered how Max Eastman would mix with the
others, but I was soon put at my ease, because Max
is clever and is just as desirous of having a good
time as anyone, in spite of intellectual differences.
That night he seemed the necessary ingredient to
make the party.</p>

<p>The fizz water must have something of the sort
of thing that old Ponce de Leon sought. Certainly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
it made us feel very young. Back to children we
leaped for the night. There were games, music,
dancing. And no wallflowers. Everyone participated.</p>

<p>We began playing charades, and Doug and Mary
showed us some clever acting. They both got on
top of a table and made believe he was the conductor
of a trolley car and she was a passenger.
After an orgy of calling out stations <i>en route</i> the
conductor came along to the passenger and collected
her fare. Then they both began dancing
around the floor, explaining that they were a couple
of fairies dancing along the side of a brook, picking
flowers. Soon Mary fell in and Douglas plunged
in after her and pulled her up on the banks of the
brook.</p>

<p>That was their problem, and, guess though we
would, we could not solve it.</p>

<p>They gave the answer finally. It was "Fairbanks."</p>

<p>Then we sang, and in Italian&mdash;at least it passed
for that. I acted with Mme. Maeterlinck. We
played a burlesque on the great dying scene of
"Camille." But we gave it a touch that Dumas
overlooked.</p>

<p>When she coughed, I got the disease immediately,
and was soon taken with convulsions and
died instead of Camille.</p>

<p>We sang some more, we danced, we got up and
made impromptu speeches on any given subject.
None were about the party, but on subjects like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
"political economy," "the fur trade,"
"feminism."</p>

<p>Each one would try to talk intelligently and
seriously on a given subject for one minute. My
subject was the "fur trade."</p>

<p>I prefaced my talk by references to cats, rabbits,
etc., and finished up by diagnosing the political
situation in Russia.</p>

<p>For me the party was a great success. I succeeded
in forgetting myself for a while. I hope the
rest of them managed to do the same thing. From
the café the party went over to a little girl's house&mdash;she
was a friend of Mr. Woolcott&mdash;and again we
burst forth in music and dancing. We made a
complete evening of it and I went to bed tired and
exhausted about five in the morning.</p>

<p>I want a long sleep, but am awakened by my
lawyer at nine. He has packages of legal documents
and papers for me to sign, my orders about
certain personal things of great importance. I have
a splitting headache. My boat is sailing at noon,
and altogether, with a lawyer for a companion, it is
a hideous day.</p>

<p>All through the morning the telephone bell is
ringing. Reporters. I listen several times, but it
never varies.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chaplin, why are you going to Europe?"</p>

<p>"To get rid of interviews," I finally shout, and
hang up the 'phone.</p>

<p>Somehow, with invaluable assistance, we get
away from the hotel and are on our way to the dock.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
My lawyer meets me there. He has come to see
me off. I tremble, though, for fear he has more
business with me.</p>

<p>I am criticised by my lawyer for talking so
sharply the first thing in the morning. That's just
it. He always sees me the first thing in the morning.
That's what makes me short.</p>

<p>But it is too big a moment. Something is stirring
within me. I am anxious and reluctant about
leaving. My emotions are all mixed.</p>

<p>It is a beautiful morning. New York looks much
finer and nicer because I am leaving it. I am
terribly troubled about passports and the usual procedure
about declaring income tax, but my lawyer
reassures me that he has fixed everything O.K.
and that my name will work a lot of influence with
the American officials; but I am very dubious about
it when I am met by the American officials at the
port.</p>

<p>I am terrified by American officials. I am
extra nice to the officials, and to my amazement
they are extra nice to me. Everything passes off
very easily.</p>

<p>As usual, my lawyer was right. He had fixed
everything. He is a good lawyer.</p>

<p>We could be such intimate friends if he wasn't.</p>

<p>But I am too thrilled to give much time to pitying
lawyers.</p>

<p>I am going to Europe.</p>

<p>The crowds of reporters, photographers, all sorts
of traffic, pushing, shoving, opening passports,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
visés O.K.'d, stamped, in perfect, almost clocklike
precision, I am shoved aboard.</p>

<p>The newspaper battery pictorial and reportorial.
There is no original note.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chaplin, why are you going to Europe?"</p>

<p>I feel that in this last moment I should be a bit
more tolerant and pleasant, no matter how difficult.
I bring forth the "prop" smile again.</p>

<p>"For a vacation," I answer.</p>

<p>Then they go through the standard interview
form and I try to be obliging.</p>

<p>Mrs. John Carpenter is on the boat&mdash;was also
invited to my party, but couldn't attend&mdash;with her
charming daughter, who has the face of an angel,
also Mr. Edward Knoblock. We are all photographed.
Doug and Mary are there. Lots of
people to see me off. Somehow I don't seem
interested in them very much. My mind is pretty
well occupied. I am trying to make conversation,
but am more interested in the people and the boat
and those who are going to travel with me.</p>

<p>Many of the passengers on the boat are bringing
their children that I may be introduced. I don't
mind children.</p>

<p>"I have seen you so many times in the pictures."</p>

<p>I find myself smiling at them graciously and pleasantly,
especially the children.</p>

<p>I doubt if I am really sincere in this, as it is too
early in the morning. Despite the fact that I love
children, I find them difficult to meet. I feel rather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
inferior to them. Most of them have assurance,
have not yet been cursed with self-consciousness.</p>

<p>And one has to be very much on his best
behaviour with children because they detect our
insincerity. I find there are quite a lot of children
on board.</p>

<p>Everyone is so pleasant, especially those left
behind. Handkerchiefs are waving. The boat is
off. We start to move, the waters are churning.
Am feeling very sad, rather regretful&mdash;think what
a nice man my lawyer is.</p>

<p>We turn around the bend and get into the
channel. The crowds are but little flies now. In
this fleeting dramatic moment there comes the feeling
of leaving something very dear behind.</p>

<p>The camera man and many of his brothers are
aboard. I discover him as I turn around. I did
not want to discover anyone just then. I wanted
to be alone with sky and water. But I am still
Charlie Chaplin. I must be photographed&mdash;and
am.</p>

<p>We are passing the Statue of Liberty. He asks
me to wave and throw kisses, which rather annoys
me.</p>

<p>The thing is too obvious. It offends my sense
of sincerity.</p>

<p>The Statue of Liberty is thrilling, dramatic, a
glorious symbol. I would feel self-conscious and
cheap in deliberately waving and throwing kisses at
it. I will be myself.</p>

<p>I refuse.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p>The incident of the photographic seeker before
the Statue of Liberty upset me. I felt that he was
trying to capitalise the statue. His request was
deliberate, insincere. It offended me. It would
have been like calling an audience to witness the
placing of flowers upon a grave. Patriotism is too
deep a feeling to depict in the posing for a photograph.
Why are attempts made to parade such
emotions? I feel glad that I have the courage to
refuse.</p>

<p>As I turn from the photographer I feel a sense of
relief. I am to have a reprieve from such annoyances.
Reporters for the while are left behind.
It is a delicious sense of security.</p>

<p>I am ready for the new adjustment. I am in a
new world, a little city of its own, where there are
new people&mdash;people who may be either pleasant or
unpleasant, and mine is the interesting job of placing
them in their proper category. I want to
explore new lands and I feel that I shall have ample
opportunity on such an immense ship. The
<i>Olympic</i> is enormous and I conjure up all sorts of
pleasure to be had in its different rooms&mdash;Turkish
baths, gymnasium, music rooms&mdash;its Ritz-Carlton
restaurant, where everything is elaborate and of
ornate splendour. I find myself looking forward to
my evening meal.</p>

<p>We go to the Ritz grill to dine. Everyone is
pleasant. I seem to sense the feel of England
immediately. Foreign food&mdash;a change of system&mdash;the
different bill of fare, with money in terms of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
pounds, shillings, and pence. And the dishes&mdash;pheasant,
grouse, and wild duck. For the first
time I feel the elegant gentleman, the man of
means.</p>

<p>I ask questions and discover that there are really
some very interesting people aboard. But I resent
anyone telling me about them. I want to discover
them myself. I almost shout when someone tries
to read me a passenger list. This is my desert
island&mdash;I am going to explore it myself. The
prospect is intriguing. I am three thousand miles
from Hollywood and three thousand miles from
Europe. For the moment I belong to neither.</p>

<p>God be praised, I am myself.</p>

<p>It is my little moment of happiness, the glorious
"to-day" that is sandwiched in between the
exhausting "yesterday" of Los Angeles and the
portentous "to-morrow" of Europe.</p>

<p>For the moment I am content.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span></p>

<h2>III.<br />
<br />
DAYS ON SHIPBOARD</h2>

<p class="p2">I notice a thoughtful-looking, studious sort of
man seated across from us. He is reading
a book, a different sort of book, if covers
mean anything. It looks formidable, a sort of intellectual
fodder. I wonder who he is. I weave all
sorts of romance about him. I place him in all
sorts of intellectual undertakings, though he may
be a college professor. I would love to know him.
I feel that he is interested in us. I mention it to
Knoblock. He keeps looking at us. Knoblock
tells me he is Gillette, the safety-razor man. I feel
like romancing about him more than ever. I
wonder what he is reading? I would love to know
him. It is our loss, I believe. And I never
learned what the book was that he was reading.</p>

<p>There are very few pretty girls aboard. I never
have any luck that way. And it is a weakness of
mine. I feel that it would be awfully pleasant to
cross the ocean with a number of nice girls who were
pretty and who would take me as I am. We
listened to the music and retired early, this because
of a promise to myself that I would do lots of reading
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
aboard. I have a copy of Max Eastman's poems,
colours of life, a volume of treasures. I try to read
them, but am too nervous. The type passes in
parade, but I assimilate nothing, so I prepare to
sleep and be in good shape for the morning. But
that is also impossible.</p>

<p>I am beyond sleep to-night now. I am in something
new, something pregnant with expectation.
The immediate future is too alluring for sleep.</p>

<p>How shall I be received in England? What
sort of a trip shall I have? Whom shall I meet on
board? The thoughts chased one another round
my brain and back again, all running into one
another in their rambling.</p>

<p>I get up at one o'clock. Decide to read again.
This time H. G. Wells's <i>Outline of History</i>.
Impossible! It doesn't register. I try to force it
by reading aloud. It can't be done. The tongue
can't cheat the brain, and right now reading is out
of the question.</p>

<p>I get up and go to see if Knoblock is in. He
sleeps audibly and convincingly. He is not
making his debut.</p>

<p>I go back to my room. I rather feel sorry for
myself. If only the Turkish baths were open I could
while a few hours of time away until morning. Thus
I mediate. The last thing I remember it is four
o'clock in the morning and the next thing eleven-thirty.
I can hear a great bit of excitement going
on outside my cabin door. There are a lot of little
children there with autograph books. I tell them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
that I will sign them later and have them leave the
books with my secretary, Tom Harrington.</p>

<p>There is a composite squeal of pleasure at this
and a sickening fear comes over me. I call Tom.
He enters amid a raft of autograph books. I start
to sign, then postpone it until after breakfast.</p>

<p>Knoblock comes in all refreshed and with that
radiant sort of cheerfulness that I resent in the
morning. Am I going to get up for lunch or will
I have it in my cabin? There is a pleading lethargy
that says, "Take it in bed," but I cannot overcome
the desire to explore and the feeling of
expectancy of something about to happen&mdash;I was to
see somebody or meet somebody&mdash;so I decide to
have luncheon in the dining-room. I am giving
myself the emotional stimulus. Nothing comes off.
We meet nobody.</p>

<p>After lunch a bit of exercise. We run around
the deck for a couple of miles. It brings back
thoughts of the days when I ran in Marathon races.
I feel rather self-conscious, however, as I am being
pointed out by passengers. With each lap it gets
worse. If there was only a place where I could
run with nobody looking. We finally stop and lean
against the rail.</p>

<p>All the stewards are curious. They are trying
to pick me out. I notice it and pretend not to
notice it. I go up into the gymnasium and look
around. There is every contrivance to give joy
to healthy bodies. And best of all, nobody else is
there. Wonderful!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>

<p>I try the weights, the rowing machine, the
travelling rings, punch the bag a bit, swing some
Indian clubs, and leap to the trapeze. Suddenly
the place is packed. News travels quickly aboard
ship. Some come for the purpose of exercising,
like myself; others out of curiosity to watch me perform.
I grow careless. I don't care to go
through with it. I put on my coat and hat and go
to my room, finding that the old once-discarded
"prop" smile is useful as I make my way through
the crowd.</p>

<p>At four o'clock we have tea. I decide that the
people are interesting. I love to meet so many.
Perhaps they are the same ones I hated to see come
into the gym, but I feel no sense of being paradoxical.
The gymnasium belongs to individuals.
The tea-room suggests and invites social intercourse.
Somehow there are barriers and conventionalities
that one cannot break, for all the vaunted
"freedom of shipboard." I feel it's a sort of
awkward situation. How is it possible to meet
people on the same footing? I hear of it, I read of
it, but somehow I cannot meet people myself and
stay myself.</p>

<p>I immediately shift any blame from myself and
decide that the first-class passengers are all snobs.
I resolve to try the second-class or the third-class.
Somehow I can't meet these people. I get
irritable and decide deliberately to seek the other
classes of passengers and the boat crew.</p>

<p>Another walk around the deck. The salt air
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
makes me feel good in spite of my mental bothers.
I look over the rail and see other passengers, second
or third class, and in one large group the ship's firemen
and stokers. They are the night force come
on deck for a breath of air between working their
shifts in the hellish heat below.</p>

<p>They see and recognise me. To their coal-blackened
faces come smiles. They shout
"Hooray!" "Hello, Charlie!" Ah, I am discovered.
But I tingle all over with pleasure. As
those leathery faces crack into lines through the dust
I sense sincerity. There is a friendly feeling. I
warm to them.</p>

<p>There is a game of cricket going on. That's
intriguing. I love cricket. Wish I could try my
hand at it. Wish there was enough spontaneity
about first-cabin passengers to start a game. I
wish I wasn't so darn self-conscious. They must
have read my thoughts. I am invited timidly, then
vociferously, to play a game. Their invitation
cheers me. I feel one of them. A spirit of adventure
beckons. I leap over the rail and right into
the midst of it.</p>

<p>I carry with me into the steerage just a bit of
self-consciousness&mdash;there are so many trying to play
upon me. I am looked upon as a celebrity, not a
cricket player. But I do my part and try and we
get into the game. Suddenly a motion-picture
camera man bobs up from somewhere. What
leeches! He snaps a picture. This gets
sickening.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>

<p>One of the crew has hurriedly made himself up
as "Charlie Chaplin." He causes great excitement.
This also impresses me. I find myself
acting a part, looking surprised and interested. I
am conscious of the fact that this thing has been
done many times before. Then on second thought
I realise it is all new to them and that they mean
well, so I try to enter into the spirit of the thing.
There comes a pause in the cricket game. Nobody
is very much interested in it.</p>

<p>I find that I have been resurrected again in
character and am the centre of attraction. There
are calls, "What have you done with your moustache?"
I look up with a grin and ready to answer
anything they ask, these chaps who labour hard
and must play the same way. But I see that
hundreds of first-class passengers are looking down
over the rail as though at a side show. This affects
my pride, though I dare say I am supersensitive.
I have an idea that they think I am "Charlie"
performing for them. This irritates me. I throw
up my hands and say, "See you to-morrow."</p>

<p>One of the bystanders presents himself.
"Charlie, don't you remember me?" I have a
vague recollection of his face, but cannot place him.</p>

<p>Now I have it, of course; we worked in some
show together. Yes, I can actually place him.
He has a negative personality. I remember that
he played a small part, a chorus man or something
of the sort. This brings back all sorts of reminiscences,
some depressing and others interesting. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
wonder what his life has been. I remember him
now very plainly. He was a bad actor, poor chap.
I never knew him very well even when we worked
in the same company. And now he is stoking in
the hold of a ship. I think I know what his emotions
are and understand the reasons. I wonder
whether he understands mine.</p>

<p>I try to be nice, even though I discover the incident
is not over interesting. But I try to make it
so&mdash;try harder just because he never meant a great
deal before. But now it seems to take on a greater
significance, the meeting with this chap, and I find
myself being extra nice to him, or at least trying to
be.</p>

<p>Darn it all, the first-class passengers are looking
on again, and I will not perform for them. They
arouse pride, indignation. I have decided to
become very exclusive on board. That's the way
to treat them.</p>

<p>It is five o'clock. I decide to take a Turkish
bath. Ah, what a difference travelling first class
after the experience in the steerage!</p>

<p>There is nothing like money. It does make life
so easy. These thoughts come easily in the
luxury of a warm bath. I feel a little more kindly
disposed toward the first-cabin passengers. After
all, I am an emotional cuss.</p>

<p>Discover that there are some very nice people
on board. I get into conversation with two or
three. They have the same ideas about lots of
things that I have. This discovery gives me a fit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
of introspection and I discover that I am, indeed,
a narrow-minded little pinhead.</p>

<p>What peculiar sights one sees in a Turkish bath.
The two extremes, fat and thin, and so seldom a
perfect physique. I am a discovered man&mdash;even
in my nakedness. One man will insist upon showing
me how to do a hand balance in the hot room.
Also a somersault and a back flip. It challenges
my nimbleness. Can I do them? Good heavens&mdash;no!
I'm not an acrobat, I'm an actor. I am
indignant.</p>

<p>Then he points out the value of regular exercise,
outlining for my benefit a daily course for me to do
aboard. I don't want any daily course and I tell
him so.</p>

<p>"But," says he, "if you keep this up for a week
you may be able to do the stunts I do."</p>

<p>But I can't see it even with that prospect ahead,
because to save my life I can't think of any use I
would have for the hand balance, somersault, or
the back flip.</p>

<p>I meet another man who has man&oelig;uvred until
he has me pinned in a corner. He shows a vital
interest in Theda Bara. Do I know her? What
sort of a person is she? Does she "vamp" in
real life? Do I know Louise Glaum? He sort
of runs to the vampish ladies. Do I know any of
the old-timers? So his conversation goes depressingly
on, with me answering mostly in the negative.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_048" id="i_048"></a>
<img src="images/i_048.jpg" width="550" height="324" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A scene from "Sunnyside," one of my favourite photo plays.</p>
</div>

<p>They must think I am very dull. Why, anyone
should know the answers to the questions they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
figure. There are grave doubts as to whether I
am Charlie Chaplin or not. I wish they would
decide that I am not. I confess that I have never
met Theda Bara. They return to motion pictures
of my own. How do I think up my funny stunts?
It is too much. Considerably against my wishes I
have to retreat from the hot room. I want to get
away from this terrible, strenuous experience.
But retreat is not so easy.</p>

<p>A little rotund individual, smiling, lets me know
that he has seen a number of my pictures. He
says:</p>

<p>"I have seen you so much in 'reel' life that
I wanted to talk to you in 'real' life." He
laughs at this bright little sally of his and I dare
say he thinks it original. The first time I heard
it I choked on my milk bottle.</p>

<p>But I grinned. I always do. He asked what I
was taking a Turkish bath for, and I told him I
was afraid of acquiring a bit of a stomach. I was
speaking his language. He knew the last word in
taking down stomachs. He went through all the
stomach-reducing routine. He rolled, he slapped,
he stretched across a couch on his stomach
while he breathed deeply and counted a hundred.
He had several other stunts but I stopped him. He
had given me enough ideas for a beginning.
He got up panting, and I noticed that the most
prominent thing about him was his stomach and that
he had the largest stomach in the room. But he
admitted that the exercise had fixed him O.K.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<p>Eventually he glanced down at my feet. "Good
heavens! I always thought you had big feet. Have
you got them insured?" I can stand it no longer.
I burst through the door into the cooling room
and on to the slab.</p>

<p>At last I am where I can relax. The masseur
is an Englishman and has seen most of my pictures.
He talks about "Shoulder Arms." He mentions
things in my pictures that I never remembered
putting there. He had always thought I was a
pretty muscular guy, but was sadly disappointed.</p>

<p>"How do you do your funny falls?" He is
surprised that I am not covered with bruises. "Do
I know Clara Kimball Young? Are most of the
people in pictures immoral?"</p>

<p>I make pretences. I am asleep. I am very
tired. An audience has drifted in and I hear a
remark about my feet.</p>

<p>I am manhandled and punched and then handed
on into another room.</p>

<p>At last I can relax. I am about to fall asleep
when one of the passengers asks if I would mind
signing my autograph for him. But I conquer
them. Patience wins and I fall asleep to be
awakened at seven o'clock and told to get out of
the bath.</p>

<p>I dress for dinner. We go into the smoking-room.
I meet the demon camera man. I do not know
him, as he is dressed up like a regular person. We
get into conversation. Well, hardly conversation.
He talks.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p>"Listen, Charlie, I am very sorry, but I've been
assigned to photograph you on this trip. Now we
might as well get to know each other and make it
easy for both of us, so the best thing to do is to
let's do it fully and get it over with. Now, let's
see, I'll take to-morrow and part of the next day.
I want to photograph you with the third-class passengers,
then the second-class, and have you shown
playing games on deck. If you have your make-up
and your moustache, hat, shoes, and cane, it
will be all the better."</p>

<p>I call for help. He will have to see my personal
representative, Mr. Robinson.</p>

<p>He says, "I won't take 'No' for an answer."</p>

<p>And I let him know that the only thing he isn't
going to do on the trip is to photograph me. I
explain that it would be a violation of contract with
the First National exhibitors.</p>

<p>"I have been assigned to photograph you and
I'm going to photograph you," he says. And
then he told me of his other camera conquests, of
his various experiences with politicians who did not
want to be photographed.</p>

<p>"I had to break through the palace walls to
photograph the King of England, but I got him.
Also had quite a time with Foch, but I have his
face in celluloid now." And he smiled as he deprecatingly
looked up and down my somewhat small
and slight figure.</p>

<p>This is the last straw. I defy him to photograph
me. For from now on I have made up my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
mind that I am going to lock myself in my cabin&mdash;I'll
fool him.</p>

<p>But my whole evening is spoiled. I go to bed
cursing the motion-picture industry, the makers of
film, and those responsible for camera men. Why
did I take the trip? What is it all for? It has
gotten beyond me already and it is my trip, my
vacation.</p>

<p>It is early, and I decide to read a bit. I pick up
a booklet of poems by Claude McKay, a young
negro poet who is writing splendid verse of the
inspired sort. Reading a few of his gems, my own
annoyances seem puny and almost childish.</p>

<p>I read:</p>

<p class="center p2">The Tropics of New York.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>Bananas ripe and green, and ginger root,</p>
<p class="i1">Cocoa in pods and alligator pears,</p>
<p>And tangerines and mangos and grapefruit,</p>
<p class="i1">Fit for the highest prize at parish fairs.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>See in the windows, bringing memories</p>
<p class="i1">Of fruit trees laden, by low-singing rills,</p>
<p>And dewy dawns and mystical blue skies.</p>
<p class="i1">In benediction over nunlike hills.</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">

<p>Mine eyes grow dim and I could no more gaze.</p>
<p class="i1">A wave of longing through my body swept,</p>
<p>And a hunger for the old, familiar ways;</p>
<p class="i1">I turned aside and bowed my head and wept.</p>
</div></div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span></p>

<p>I read again:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<p>Lovely, dainty Spanish Needle,</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>I am passing this along because I don't believe
it is published in this country, and I feel as though
I am extending a rare treat. They brought me
better rest that night&mdash;a splendid sleep.</p>

<p>Next morning there were more autograph books
and several wireless messages from intimate friends
wishing me <i>bon voyage</i>. They are all very
interesting.</p>

<p>Also there are about two hundred ship postcards.
Would I mind signing them for the stewards? I am
feeling very good-natured and I enjoy signing anything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
this morning. I pass the forenoon till lunch
time.</p>

<p>I really feel as though I haven't met anybody.
They say that barriers are lowered aboard ship,
but not for me.</p>

<p>Ed. Knoblock and I keep very much to ourselves.
But all the time I have been sort of
wondering what became of the beautiful opera
singer who came aboard and was photographed
with me. I wonder if being photographed
together constitutes an introduction? I have not
seen her since the picture.</p>

<p>We get seats in deck chairs. Knoblock and
myself. Ed. is busy reading <i>Economic Democracy</i>
by some one important. I have splendid
intentions of reading Wells's <i>Outline of History</i>.
My intentions falter after a few paragraphs. I
look at the sea, at people passing all around the
ship. Every once in a while I glance at Knoblock
hoping that he is overcome by his book and that
he will look up, but Knoblock apparently has no
such intention.</p>

<p>Suddenly I notice, about twenty chairs away,
the beautiful singer. I don't know why I always
have this peculiar embarrassment that grips me
now. I am trying to make up my mind to go over
and make myself known. No, such an ordeal
would be too terrific. The business of making
oneself known is a problem. Here she is within
almost speaking distance and I am not sure whether
I shall meet her or not. I glance away again. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
is looking in my direction. I pretend not to see
her and quickly turn my head and get into conversation
with Knoblock, who thinks I have suddenly
gone insane.</p>

<p>"Isn't that lady the opera singer?" I ask.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>That about expresses his interest.</p>

<p>"Shouldn't we go over and make ourselves
known?" I suggest.</p>

<p>"By all means, if you wish it." And he is up
and off almost before I can catch my breath.</p>

<p>We get up and walk around the deck. I just do
not know how to meet people. At last the moment
comes in the smoking-room, where they are having
"log auction." She is with two gentlemen. We
meet. She introduces one as her husband, the
other as a friend.</p>

<p>She reprimands me for not speaking to her
sooner. I try to pretend that I had not seen her.
This amuses her mightily and she becomes charming.
We become fast friends. Both she and her
husband join us at dinner the following night. We
recall mutual friends. Discover that there are quite
a lot of nice people aboard. She is Mme. Namara
and in private life Mrs. Guy Bolton, wife of the
author of "Sally." They are on their way to
London where he is to witness the English opening
of "Sally." We have a delightful evening at
dinner and then later in their cabin.

<h2>IV.<br />
<br />
HELLO, ENGLAND!</h2>

<p class="p2">Everything sails along smoothly and
delightfully until the night of the concert for
the seaman's fund. This entertainment is customary
on all liners and usually is held on the last
night out. The passengers provide the entertainment.</p>

<p>I am requested to perform. The thought scares
me. It is a great tragedy, and, much as I would
like to do something, I am too exhausted and tired.
I beg to be excused, I never like making appearances
in public. I find that they are always
disappointing.</p>

<p>I give all manner of reasons for not appearing&mdash;one
that I have no particular thing to do, nothing
arranged for, that it is against my principles
because it spoils illusion&mdash;especially for the
children. When they see me minus my hat, cane,
and shoes, it is like taking the whiskers off Santa
Claus. And not having my equipment with me,
I feel very conscious of this. I am always self-conscious
when meeting children without my make-up
for that very reason. I must say the officers were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
very sympathetic and understood my reasons for
not wanting to appear, and I can assure you that
the concert was a distinct success without me.
There were music and recitations and singing and
dancing, and one passenger did a whistling act,
imitating various birds and animals, also the sawing
of wood, with the screeching sound made when the
saw strikes a knot. It was very effective.</p>

<p>I watched and enjoyed the concert immensely
until near the end, when the entertainment chairman
announced that I was there and that if the
audience urged strongly enough I might do something
for them. This was very disconcerting, and
after I had explained that I was physically
exhausted and had nothing prepared I am sure the
audience understood. The chairman, however,
announced that it did not matter, as they could see
Charlie Chaplin at any time for a nickel&mdash;and that's
that.</p>

<p>The next day is to be the last aboard. We are
approaching land. I have got used to the boat and
everybody has got used to me. I have ceased to
be a curiosity. They have taken me at my face
value&mdash;face without moustache and kindred make-up.
We have exchanged addresses, cards, invitations;
have made new friends, met a lot of charming
people, names too numerous to mention.</p>

<p>The lighter is coming out. The top deck is
black with men. Somebody tells me they are
French and British camera men coming to welcome
me. I am up on the top deck, saying good-bye to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
Mme. Namara and her husband. They are getting
off at Cherbourg. We are staying aboard.</p>

<p>Suddenly there is an avalanche. All sorts and
conditions of men armed with pads, pencils, motion-picture
cameras, still cameras. There is an embarrassing
pause. They are looking for Charlie
Chaplin. Some have recognised me. I see them
searching among our little group. Eventually I
am pointed out.</p>

<p>"Why, here he is!"</p>

<p>My friends suddenly become frightened and
desert me. I feel very much alone, the victim.
Square-headed gentlemen with manners different&mdash;they
are raising their hats.</p>

<p>"Do I speak French?" Some are speaking in
French to me&mdash;it means nothing, I am
bewildered. Others English. They all seem too
curious to even do their own business. I find that
they are personally interested. Camera men are
forgetting to shoot their pictures.</p>

<p>But they recover themselves after their
curiosity has been gratified. Then the deluge.</p>

<p>"Are you visiting in London?"</p>

<p>"Why did you come over?"</p>

<p>"Did you bring your make-up?"</p>

<p>"Are you going to make pictures over here?"</p>

<p>Then from Frenchmen:</p>

<p>"Will I visit France?"</p>

<p>"Am I going to Russia?"</p>

<p>I try to answer them all.</p>

<p>"Will you visit Ireland?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't expect to do so."</p>

<p>"What do you think of the Irish question?"</p>

<p>"It requires too much thought."</p>

<p>"Are you a Bolshevik?"</p>

<p>"I am an artist, not a politician."</p>

<p>"Why do you want to visit Russia?"</p>

<p>"Because I am interested in any new idea."</p>

<p>"What do you think of Lenin?"</p>

<p>"I think him a very remarkable man."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because he is expressing a new idea."</p>

<p>"Do you believe in Bolshevism?"</p>

<p>"I am not a politician?"</p>

<p>Others ask me to give them a message to
France. A message to London. What have I to
say to the people of Manchester? Will I meet
Bernard Shaw? Will I meet H. G. Wells? Is
it true that I am going to be knighted? How would
I solve the unemployment problem?</p>

<p>In the midst of all this a rather mysterious gentleman
pulls me to one side and tells me that he knew
my father intimately and acted as agent for him in
his music-hall engagements. Did I anticipate
working? If so, he could get me an engagement.
Would I give him the first opportunity? Anyway,
he was very pleased to meet me. If I wanted a
nice quiet rest I could come down to his place and
spend a few days with my kind of people, the people
I liked.</p>

<p>I am rescued by my secretaries, who insist that I
go to my cabin and lie down. Anything the newspaper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
men have to ask they will answer for me.
I am dragged away bewildered.</p>

<p>Is this what I came six thousand miles for? Is
this rest? Where is that vacation that I pictured
so vividly?</p>

<p>I lie down and nap until dinner time. I have
dinner in my cabin. Now comes another great
problem.</p>

<p>Tipping. One has the feeling that if you are
looked at you should tip. One thing that I believe
in, though&mdash;tipping. It gets you good service.
It is money well spent. But when and how to tip&mdash;that
is the question. It is a great problem on
shipboard.</p>

<p>There's the bedroom steward, the waiter, the
head waiter, the hallboy, the deck steward, boots,
bathroom steward, Turkish bath attendants,
gymnasium instructor, smoking-room steward,
lounge-room steward, page boys, elevator boys,
barber. It is depressing. I am harassed as to
whether to tip the doctor and the captain.</p>

<p>I am all excited now; full of expectancy. Wonder
what's going to happen. After my first encounter
with fifty newspaper men at Cherbourg, somehow
I do not resent it. Rather like it, in fact. Being
a personage is not so bad. I am prepared for the
fray. It is exciting. I am advancing on Europe.
One o'clock. I am in my cabin. We are to dock
in the morning.</p>

<p>I look out of the porthole. I hear voices. They
are alongside the dock. Am very emotional now.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
The mystery of it out there in blackness envelops
me. I revel in it&mdash;its promise. We are at Southampton.
We are in England.</p>

<p>To-morrow! I go to bed thinking of it. To-morrow!</p>

<p>I try to sleep, childishly reasoning that in sleeping
I will make the time pass more quickly. My
reasoning was sound, perhaps, but somewhere in
my anatomy there slipped a cog. I could not sleep.
I rolled and tossed, counted sheep, closed my eyes
and lay perfectly still, but it was no go. Somewhere
within me there stirred a sort of Christmas
Eve feeling. To-morrow was too portentous.</p>

<p>I look at my watch. It is two o'clock in the
morning. I look through the porthole. It is pitch
dark outside. I try to pierce the darkness, but
can't. Off in the distance I hear voices coming out
of the night. That and the lapping of the waves
against the side of the boat.</p>

<p>Then I hear my name mentioned once, twice,
three times. I am thrilled. I tingle with
expectancy and varying emotions. It is all so
peculiar and mysterious. I try to throw off the
feeling. I can't.</p>

<p>There seems to be no one awake except a couple
of men who are pacing the deck. Longshoremen,
probably. Every once in a while I hear the mystic
"Charlie Chaplin" mentioned. I peer through
the porthole. It is starting to rain. This adds to
the spell. I turn out the lights and get back to bed
and try to sleep. I get up again and look out.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>

<p>I call Robinson. "Can you sleep?" I ask.</p>

<p>"No. Let's get up and dress." It's got him,
too.</p>

<p>We get up and walk around the top deck. There
is a curious mixture of feelings all at once. I am
thrilled and depressed. I cannot understand the
depression. We keep walking around the deck,
looking over the side. People are looking up, but
they don't recognise me in the night. I feel myself
speculating, wondering if it is going to be the welcome
I am expecting.</p>

<p>Scores of messages have been arriving all day.</p>

<p>"Will you accept engagements?" "Will you
dine with us?" "How about a few days in the
country?" I cannot possibly answer them all.
Not receiving replies, they send wireless messages
to the captain.</p>

<p>"Mr. Lathom, is Mr. Chaplin on board?"
"Has my message been delivered?"</p>

<p>I have never received so many messages. "Will
you appear on Tuesday?" "Will you dine here?"
"Will you join a revue?" "Are you open for
engagements?" "I am the greatest agent in the
world."</p>

<p>One of the messages is from the Mayor of Southampton,
welcoming me to that city. Others from
heads of the motion-picture industry in Europe.
This is a source of great worriment. Welcomed
by the mayor. It will probably mean a speech. I
hate speeches, I can't make them. This is the
worst spectre of the night.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span></p>

<p>In my sleeplessness I go back to my cabin and
try to write down what I shall say, trying to anticipate
what the mayor will say to me. I picture his
speech of welcome. A masterpiece of oratory
brought forth after much preparation by those who
are always making speeches. It is their game, this
speech-making, and I know I shall appear a hopeless
dub with my reply.</p>

<p>But I attack it valiantly. I write sentence after
sentence and then practise before the mirror.</p>

<p>"Mr. Mayor and the people of Southampton."
The face that peers back at me from the mirror
looks rather silly. I think of Los Angeles and
wonder how they would take my speech there. But
I persevere. I write more. I overcome that face
in the looking-glass to such an extent that I want a
wider audience.</p>

<p>I call Carl Robinson. I make him sit still and
listen. I make my speech several times. He is
kind the first time and the second time, but after
that he begins to get fidgety. He makes suggestions.
I take out some lines and put in others. I
decide that it is prepared and leave it. I am to
meet the mayor in the morning at eight o'clock.</p>

<p>Eventually I get to bed and asleep, a fitful, tossing
sleep. They wake me in the morning. People
are outside my door. Carl comes in.</p>

<p>"The mayor is upstairs waiting for you." I
am twenty minutes late. This adds to my
inefficiency.</p>

<p>I am pushed and tumbled into my clothes, then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
taken by the arm, as if I were about to be arrested,
and led from my cabin. Good Lord! I've forgotten
my slip&mdash;my speech, my answer to the mayor, with
its platform gestures that I had laboured with
during the long night. I believed that I had created
some new gestures never before attempted on platform,
or in pulpit, but I was lost without my copy.</p>

<p>But there is little time for regrets. It doesn't
take long to reach any place when that place is
holding something fearful for you. I was before
the mayor long before I was ready to see him.</p>

<p>This mayor wasn't true to type. He was more
like a schoolmaster. Very pleasant and concise,
with tortoiseshell rims to his glasses and with none
of the ornaments of chain and plush that I had anticipated
as part of the regalia of his office. This
was somewhat of a relief.</p>

<p>There are lots of men, women and children
gathered about. I am introduced to the children.
I am whirled around into the crowd, and when I
turn back I can't quite make out who is the mayor.
There seems to be a roomful of mayors. Eventually
I am dug from behind. I turn. I am
whirled back by friendly or official assistance. Ah,
here is the mayor.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_066" id="i_066"></a>
<img src="images/i_066.jpg" width="550" height="351" alt="" />
<p class="caption">I am welcomed by the Mayor of Southampton.</p>
</div>

<p>I stand bewildered, twirling my thumbs, quite at
a loss as to what is expected of me.</p>

<p>The mayor begins. I have been warned that it
is going to be very formal.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chaplin, on behalf of the citizens of Southampton&mdash;"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing like I had anticipated. I am trying to
think. Trying to hear precisely what he says. I
think I have him so far. But it is nothing like I
had anticipated. My speech doesn't seem to fit
what he is saying. I can't help it. I will use it
anyhow, at least as much as I can recall.</p>

<p>It is over. I mumble some inane appreciation.
Nothing like I had written, with nary a gesture so
laboriously rehearsed.</p>

<p>There comes interruptions of excited mothers
with their children.</p>

<p>"This is my little girl."</p>

<p>I am shaking hands mechanically with everybody.
From all sides autograph albums are being
shoved under my nose. Carl is warding them off,
protecting me as much as possible.</p>

<p>I am aware that the mayor is still standing there.
I am trying to think of something more to say. All
visions of language seem to have left me. I find
myself mumbling. "This is nice of you" and
"I am very glad to meet you all."</p>

<p>Somebody whispers in my ear, "Say something
about the English cinema." "Say a word
of welcome to the English." I try to and can't
utter a word, but the same excitement that had
bothered me now comes forward to my aid.</p>

<p>The whole thing is bewildering and thrilling and
I find that I am pleased with it all.</p>

<p>But now strange faces seem to fade out and
familiar ones take their places. There is Tom
Geraghty, who used to be Doug Fairbanks's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
scenario writer. He wrote "When the Clouds
Roll By" and "The Mollycoddle." Tom is a
great friend of mine and we have spent many a
pleasant hour in Doug's home in Los Angeles.
There is Donald Crisp, who played Battling
Burrows in "Broken Blossoms," a clubmate in the
Los Angeles Athletic Club.</p>

<p>My cousin, Aubrey Chaplin, a rather dignified
gentleman, but with all the earmarks of a Chaplin,
greets me.</p>

<p>Heavens! I look something like him. I picture
myself in another five years. Aubrey has a saloon
in quite a respectable part of London. I feel that
Aubrey is a nice simple soul and quite desirous of
taking me in hand.</p>

<p>Then Abe Breman, manager of the United
Artists' affairs in England. And there is "Sonny,"
a friend in the days when I was on the stage. I have
not heard from him in ten years. It makes me
happy and interested, the thought of reviving the
old friendship.</p>

<p>We talk of all sorts of subjects. Sonny is prosperous
and doing well. He tells me everything in
jerky asides, as we are hustled about amidst the
baggage and bundled into a compartment that somebody
has arranged.</p>

<p>Somehow the crowds here are not so large as I
had anticipated. I am a little shocked. What if
they don't turn up? Every one has tried to impress
upon me the size of the reception I am to get.
There is a tinge of disappointment, but then I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
informed that, the boat being a day late, the crowd
expected had no way of knowing when I would
arrive.</p>

<p>This explanation relieves me tremendously,
though it is not so much for myself that I feel this,
but for my companions and my friends, who expect
so much. I feel that the whole thing should go off
with a bang for their sake. Yes, I do.</p>

<p>But I am in England. There is freshness. There
is glow. There is Nature in its most benevolent
mood. The trains, those little toy trains with the
funny little wheels like those on a child's toy. There
are strange noises. They come from the engine&mdash;snorting,
explosive sounds, as though it was clamoring
for attention.</p>

<p>I am in another world. Southampton, though I
have been there before, is absolutely strange to me.
There is nothing familiar. I feel as though I am
in a foreign country. Crowds, increasing with
every minute. What lovely women, different from
American women. How, why, I cannot tell.</p>

<p>There is a beautiful girl peering at me, a lovely
English type. She comes to the carriage and in a
beautiful, musical voice says, "May I have your
signature, Mr. Chaplin?" This is thrilling. Aren't
English girls charming? She is just the type you
see in pictures, something like Hall Caine's Gloria
in <i>The Christian</i>&mdash;beautiful auburn hair, about
seventeen.</p>

<p>Seventeen! What an age! I was that once&mdash;and
here, in England. It seems very long ago.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<p>Tom Geraghty and the bunch, we are all so
excited we don't know just what to do or how to act.
We cannot collect ourselves. Bursting with pent-up
questions of years of gathering, overflowing
with important messages for one another, we are
talking about the most commonplace things. I
find that I am not listening to them, nor they to me.
I am just taking it all in, eyes and ears.</p>

<p>An English "bobby." Everything is different.
Taking the tickets. The whole thing is upside
down. The locking us in our compartment. I
look at the crowds. The same old "prop" smile
is working. They smile. They cheer. I wave
my hat. I feel silly, but it seems that they like it.
Will the train never start? I want to see something
outside the station.</p>

<p>I want to see the country. They are all saying
things. I do not know what they all think of me,
my friends. I wish they were not here. I would
love to be alone so that I could get it all.</p>

<p>We are moving. I sit forward as though to make
the train go faster. I want a sight of Old England.
I want more than a sight.</p>

<p>Now I see the English country. New houses
going up everywhere. New types for labouring
men. More new houses. I have never seen Old
England in such a frenzy of building. The brush
fields are rather burned up. This is something new
for England, for it is always so green. It is not as
green as it used to be. But it is England, and I am
loving every mile of it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span></p>

<p>I discover that everything is Los Angeles in my
compartment, with the exception of my cousin and
Sonny. Here I am in the midst of Hollywood. I
have travelled six thousand miles to get away from
Hollywood. Motion pictures are universal. You
can't run away from them. But I am not bothering
much, because I am cannily figuring on shaking
the whole lot of them after the usual dinner and
getting off by myself.</p>

<p>And I am getting new thrills every minute. There
are people waiting all along the line, at small
stations, waiting for the train to pass. I know they
are waiting to see me. It's a wonderful sensation&mdash;everybody
so affectionate. Gee! I am wondering
what's going to happen in London?</p>

<p>Aubrey and the bunch are talking about making
a strong-arm squad around me for protection. I
intimately feel that it is not going to be necessary.
They say: "Ah, you don't know, my boy. Wait
until you get to London."</p>

<p>Secretly, I am hoping it is true. But I have my
doubts. Everybody is nice. They suggest that I
should sleep awhile, as I look tired. I feel that I
am being pampered and spoiled. But I like it.
And they all seem to understand.</p>

<p>My cousin interests me. He warns me what to
talk about. At first I felt a little conscious in his
presence. A little sensitive. His personality&mdash;how
it mixes with my American friends. I sense
that I am shocking him with my American points of
view.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span></p>

<p>He has not seen me in ten years. I know that I
am altered. I sort of want to pose before him a
little. I want to shock him; no, not exactly shock
him, but surprise him. I find myself deliberately
posing and just for him. I want to be different, and
I want him to know that I am a different person.
This is having its effect.</p>

<p>Aubrey is bewildered. I am sure that he doesn't
know me. I feel that I am not acting according to
his schedule. It encourages me.</p>

<p>I become radical in my ideas. Against his conservatism.
But I am beginning not to like this performing
for him. One feels so conscious. I am
wondering whether he will understand. There are
lots of other people I have got to meet. I won't be
able to devote all my time to him. I shall have a
long talk with Aubrey later and explain everything.
I doze off for a while.</p>

<p>But just for a moment. We are coming to the
outskirts of London. I hear nothing, I see nothing,
but I know it is so and I awake. Now I am all
expectancy. We are entering the suburbs of the
city.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<h2>V.<br />
<br />
I ARRIVE IN LONDON</h2>

<p class="p2">London! There are familiar buildings.
This is thrilling. The same buildings.
They have not altered. I expected that England
would be altered. It isn't. It's the same. The
same as I left it, in spite of the War. I see no
change, not even in the manner of the people.</p>

<p>There's Doulton's Potteries! And look, there's
the Queen's Head public-house that my cousin
used to own. I point it out to him decidedly, but
he reminds me that he has a much better place now.
Now we are coming into the Cut. Can it be true?
I can see two or three familiar stores. This train
is going too fast. I want more time with these
discoveries. I find my emotions almost too much
for me. I have more sentiment about the buildings
than I have the people.</p>

<p>The recognition of these localities! There is a
lump rising in my throat from somewhere. It is
something inexplicable. They are there, thank
God!</p>

<p>If I could only be alone with it all. With it as it
is, and with it as I would people it with ghosts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
yesterday. I wish these people weren't in the
compartment. I am afraid of my emotions.</p>

<p>The dear old Cut. We are getting into it now.
Here we are. There are all conceivable kinds of
noises, whistles, etc. Crowds, throngs lined up
on the platforms. Here comes a police sergeant
looking for a culprit. He looks straight at me.
Good Lord! I am going to be arrested! But no,
he smiles.</p>

<p>A shout, "There he is!"</p>

<p>Previous to this we had made resolutions.
"Don't forget we are all to lock arms, Knoblock,
my cousin, Robinson, Geraghty, and myself."</p>

<p>Immediately I get out of the train, however, we
somehow get disorganised and our campaign
man&oelig;uvre is lost. Policemen take me by each
arm. There are motion-picture men, still-camera
men. I see a sign announcing that motion pictures
of my trip on board ship will be shown that night at
a picture theatre. That dogged photographer of
the boat must have gotten something in spite of me.</p>

<p>I am walking along quite the centre of things. I
feel like royalty. I find I am smiling. A regular
smile. I distinguish distant faces among those
who crowd about me. There are voices at the end
of the platform.</p>

<p>"Here he is. He is there, he is. That's
him." My step is lightning gay. I am enjoying
each moment. I am in Waterloo Station, London.</p>

<p>The policemen are very excited. It is going to
be a terrible ordeal for them. Thousands are outside.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
This also thrills me. Everything is beyond
my expectations. I revel in it secretly. They all
stop to applaud as I come to the gate. Some of
them say:</p>

<p>"Well done, Charlie." I wonder if they mean
my present stunt between the bobbies. It is too
much for me.</p>

<p>What have I done? I feel like a cricketer who
has made a hundred and is going to the stand.
There is real warm affection. Do I deserve even
a part of it?</p>

<p>A young girl rushes out, breaks the line, makes
one leap, and smothers me with a kiss. Thank
God, she is pretty. There seem to be others ready
to follow her, and I find myself hesitating a bit on
my way. It is a signal. The barriers are broken.</p>

<p>They are coming on all sides. Policemen are
elbowing and pushing. Girls are shrieking.</p>

<p>"Charlie! Charlie! There he is! Good
luck to you. Charlie. God bless you." Old men,
old women, girls, boys, all in one excited thrill. My
friends are missing. We are fighting our way
through the crowd. I do not mind it at all. I am
being carried on the crest of a wave. Everybody
is working but me. There seems to be no effort.
I am enjoying it&mdash;lovely.</p>

<p>Eventually we get through to the street. It is
worse here. "Hooray!" "Here he is!" "Good
luck, Charlie!" "Well done, Charlie!" "God
bless you. God love you!" "Good luck,
Charlie!" Bells are ringing. Handkerchiefs are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
waving. Some are raising their hats. I have lost
mine. I am bewildered, at a loss, wondering where
it is all leading to, but I don't care. I love to stay
in it.</p>

<p>Suddenly there is a terrific crash. Various currents
of the crowd are battling against one another.
I find that now I am concerned about my friends.
Where's Tom? Where's So-and-so? Where's
Carl? Where's my cousin? I'm asking it all
aloud, on all sides, of anyone who will listen to me.
I am answered with smiles.</p>

<p>I am being pushed toward an automobile.</p>

<p>"Where's my cousin?" Another push.</p>

<p>Policemen on all sides. I am pushed and lifted
and almost dumped into the limousine. My hat is
thrown in behind me. There are three policemen
on each side of the car, standing on the running
board. I can't get out. They are telling the chauffeur
to drive on. He seems to be driving
right over the people. Occasionally a head, a
smiling face, a hand, a hat flashes by the door of
the car. I ask and keep asking, "Where's my
cousin?"</p>

<p>But I regain myself, straighten my clothes, cool
off a bit, and look round. There is a perfect
stranger in the limousine with me. I seem to take
him for granted for the moment. He is also cut up
and bleeding. Evidently he is somebody. He
must be on the schedule to do something. He
looks bewildered and confused.</p>

<p>I say, "Well&mdash;I have missed my cousin."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span></p>

<p>He says, "I beg your pardon, I have not been
introduced to you."</p>

<p>"Do you know where we are going?" I ask.</p>

<p>He says, "No."</p>

<p>"Well, what are you doing&mdash;Who are you?"
I splutter.</p>

<p>"No one in particular," he answers. "I have
been pushed in here against my will. I think it
was the second time you cried for your cousin. One
of the cops picked me, but I don't believe there is
any relationship."</p>

<p>We laugh. That helps. We pull up and he is
politely let off at the corner. As quickly as possible
he is shut out. Crowds are around on both
sides, raising their hats English fashion, as though
they were meeting a lady. The mounted policemen
leave us. I am left alone with my thoughts.</p>

<p>If I could only do something&mdash;solve the unemployment
problem or make some grand gesture&mdash;in
answer to all this. I look through the window in
the back of the car. There are a string of taxis
following behind. In the lead, seated on top of the
cab, is a young and pretty girl all dressed in scarlet.
She is waving to me as she chases. What a picture
she makes! I think what good fun it would
be to get on top of the cab with her and race around
through the country.</p>

<p>I feel like doing something big. What an opportunity
for a politician to say something and do something
big! I never felt such affection. We are
going down York Road. I see placards, "Charlie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
Arrives." Crowds standing on the corner, all
lined up along my way to the hotel. I am beginning
to wonder what it's all about.</p>

<p>Am feeling a bit reflective, after all, thinking
over what I have done; it has not been very much.
Nothing to call forth all this. "Shoulder Arms"
was pretty good, perhaps, but all this clamour over
a moving-picture actor!</p>

<p>Now we are passing over Westminster Bridge.
There are double-decked street cars. There's one
marked "Kennington."</p>

<p>I want to get out and get on it&mdash;I want to go to
Kennington. The bridge is so small; I always
thought it was much wider. We are held up by
traffic. The driver tells the bobby that Charlie
Chaplin is inside. There is a change in the expression
of the cop.</p>

<p>"On your way."</p>

<p>By this time the policemen have dropped off the
side of the car and are on their way back. Once
more I am a private citizen. I am just a bit sad at
this. Being a celebrity has its nice points.</p>

<p>There is an auto with a motion-picture camera
on top of it photographing our car. I tell the
driver to put down the top. Why didn't we do
this before? I wanted to let the people see. It
seemed a shame to hide in this way. I wanted to
be seen. There are little crowds on the street
corners again.</p>

<p>Ah yes, and Big Ben. It looks so small now.
It was so big before I went away. We are turning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
up the Haymarket. People are looking and
waving from their windows. I wave back.
Crowded streets. We are nearing the Ritz, where
I am to stop.</p>

<p>The crowds are much denser here. I am at a
loss. I don't know what to do, what to say. I
stand up. I wave and bow at them,
smile at them, and go through the motions
of shaking hands, using my own hands.
Should I say something? Can I say anything?
I feel the genuineness of it all, a real warmth. It
is very touching. This is almost too much for me.
I am afraid I am going to make a scene.</p>

<p>I stand up. The crowd comes to a hush. It is
attentive. They see I am about to say something.
I am surprised at my own voice. I can hear it.
It is quite clear and distinct, saying something about
its being a great moment, etc. But tame and stupid
as it is, they like it.</p>

<p>There is a "Hooray!" "Good boy, Charlie!"</p>

<p>Now the problem is how am I going to get out
of this? The police are there, pushing and shoving
people aside to make way, but they are out-numbered.
There are motion-picture cameras,
cameras on the steps. The crowds close
in. Then I step out. They close in. I am
still smiling. I try to think of something useful,
learned from my experience at the New York opening
of "The Three Musketeers." But I am not
much help to my comrades.</p>

<p>Then as we approach, the tide comes in toward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
the gates of the hotel. They have been kept
locked to prevent the crowd from demolishing the
building. I can see one intrepid motion-picture
camera man at the door as the crowd starts to
swarm. He begins to edge in, and starts grinding
his camera frantically as he is lifted into the whirlpool
of humanity. But he keeps turning, and his
camera and himself are gradually turned up to the
sky, and his lens is registering nothing but clouds as
he goes down turning&mdash;the most honorable fall a
camera man can have, to go down grinding. I
wonder if he really got any pictures.</p>

<p>In some way my body has been pushed, carried,
lifted, and projected into the hotel. I can assure
you that through no action of mine was this accomplished.
I am immediately introduced to some
English nobleman. The air is electric. I feel
now I am free. Everybody is smiling. Everybody
is interested. I am shown to a suite of rooms.</p>

<p>I like the hotel lobby. It is grand. I am raced
to my room. There are bouquets of flowers from
two or three English friends whom I had forgotten.
There come cards. I want to welcome them all.
Do not mind in the least. Am out for the whole
day of it. The crowds are outside. The manager
presents himself. Everything has been spread to
make my stay as happy as possible.</p>

<p>The crowd outside is cheering. What is the
thing to do? I had better go to the window. I
raise my hands again. I pantomime, shake hands
with myself, throw them kisses. I see a bouquet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
of roses in the room. I grab it and start tossing the
flowers into the crowd. There is a mad scramble
for the souvenirs. In a moment the chief of police
bursts into my room.</p>

<p>"Please, Mr. Chaplin, it is very fine, but don't
throw anything. You will cause an accident. They
will be crushed and killed. Anything but that,
don't throw anything. If you don't mind, kindly
refrain from throwing anything." Excitedly he
repeats his message over and over again.</p>

<p>Of course I don't mind; the flowers are all gone,
anyway. But I am theatrically concerned. "Ah,
really I am so sorry. Has anything happened?"
I feel that everything is all right.</p>

<p>The rest of my friends arrive all bruised and cut
up. Now that the excitement has died down,
what are we going to do? For no reason at all
we order a meal. Nobody is hungry. I want to
get out again. Wish I could.</p>

<p>I feel that everybody ought to leave immediately.
I want to be alone. I want to get out and escape
from all crowds. I want to get over London, over
to Kennington, all by myself. I want to see some
familiar sights. Here baskets of fruit keep pouring
in, fresh bouquets, presents, trays full of cards,
some of them titles, some well-known names&mdash;all
paying their respects. Now I am muddled. I
don't know what to do first. There is too much
waiting. I have too much of a choice.</p>

<p>But I must get over to Kennington, and to-day.
I am nervous, overstrung, tense. Crowds are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
still outside. I must go again and bow and wave
my hands. I am used to it, am doing it mechanically;
it has no effect. Lunch is ordered for everybody.
Newspaper men are outside, visitors are
outside. I tell Carl to get them to put it off until
to-morrow. He tells them that I am tired, need a
rest, for them to call to-morrow and they will be
given an interview.</p>

<p>The bishop of something presents his compliments.
He is in the room when I arrive. I can't
hear what he is saying. I said 'yes, I shall be
delighted.' We sit down to lunch. What a crowd
there is eating with me! I am not quite sure I
know them all.</p>

<p>Everyone is making plans for me. This irritates
me. My cousin, Tom Geraghty, Knoblock&mdash;would
I spend two or three days in the country and
get a rest? No. I don't want to rest. Will you
see somebody? I don't want to see anybody. I
want to be left entirely alone. I've just got to have
my whim.</p>

<p>I make a pretence at lunch. I whisper to Carl,
"You explain everything to them&mdash;tell them that
I am going out immediately after lunch." I am
merely taking the lunch to discipline myself.</p>

<p>I look out the window. The crowds are still
there. What a problem! How am I going to get out
without being recognised? Shall I openly suggest
going out, so I can get away? I hate disappointing
them. But I must go out.</p>

<p>Tom Geraghty, Donald Crisp, and myself suggest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
taking a walk. I do not tell them my plans,
merely suggest taking the walk. We go through
the back way and escape. I am sure that everything
is all right, and that no one will recognise
me. I cannot stand the strain any longer. I tell
Donald and Tom&mdash;they really must leave me alone.
I want to be alone, and want to visit alone.
They understand. Tom is a good sort and so is
Donald. I do not want to ride, but just for a
quicker means of getting away I call a taxicab.</p>

<p>I tell him to drive to Lambeth. He is a good
driver, and an old one. He has not recognised me,
thank heaven!</p>

<p>But he is going too fast. I tell him to drive
slower, to take his time. I sit back now. I am
passing Westminster Bridge again. I see it better.
Things are more familiar. On the other side is
the new London County Council building. They
have been building it for years. They started it
before I left.</p>

<p>The Westminster Road has become very
dilapidated, but perhaps it is because I am riding
in an automobile. I used to travel across it another
way. It doesn't seem so long ago, either.</p>

<p>My God! Look! Under the bridge! There's
the old blind man. I stop the driver and drive
back. We pull up outside the Canterbury.</p>

<p>"You wait there, or do you want me to pay you
off?" He will wait. I walk back.</p>

<p>There he is, the same old figure, the same old
blind man I used to see as a child of five, with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
same old earmuffs, with his back against the wall
and the same stream of greasy water trickling down
the stone behind his back.</p>

<p>The same old clothes, a bit greener with age,
and the irregular bush of whiskers coloured almost
in a rainbow array, but with a dirty grey
predominant.</p>

<p>What a symbol from which to count the years
that I had been away. A little more green to his
clothes! A bit more grey in his matted beard!</p>

<p>He has that same stark look in his eyes that used
to make me sick as a child. Everything exactly
the same, only a bit more dilapidated.</p>

<p>No. There is a change. The dirty little mat
for the unhealthy-looking pup with the watering
eyes that used to be with him&mdash;that is gone. I
would like to hear the story of the missing pup.</p>

<p>Did its passing make much difference to the
lonely derelict? Was its ending a tragic one,
dramatic, or had it just passed out naturally?</p>

<p>The old man is laboriously reading the same
chapter from his old, greasy, and bethumbed
embossed Bible. His lips move, but silently, as
his fingers travel over the letters. I wonder if he
gets comfort there? Or does he need comfort?</p>

<p>To me it is all too horrible. He is the personification
of poverty at its worst, sunk in that
inertia that comes of lost hope. It is too terrible.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<h2>VI.<br />
<br />
THE HAUNTS OF MY CHILDHOOD</h2>

<p class="p2">I jump into the automobile again and we drive
along past Christ Church. There's Baxter
Hall, where we used to see magic-lantern
slides for a penny. The forerunner of the movie
of to-day. I see significance in everything around
me. You could get a cup of coffee and a piece of
cake there and see the Crucifixion of Christ all at the
same time.</p>

<p>We are passing the police station. A drear
place to youth. Kennington Road is more intimate.
It has grown beautiful in its decay. There is something
fascinating about it.</p>

<p>Sleepy people seem to be living in the streets
more than they used to when I played there. Kennington
Baths, the reason for many a day's hookey.
You could go swimming there, second class, for
three pence (if you brought your own swimming
trunks).</p>

<p>Through Brook Street to the upper Bohemian
quarter, where third-rate music-hall artists appear.
All the same, a little more decayed, perhaps. And
yet it is not just the same.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span></p>

<p>I am seeing it through other eyes. Age trying
to look back through the eyes of youth. A
common pursuit, though a futile one.</p>

<p>It is bringing home to me that I am a different
person. It takes the form of art; it is beautiful.
I am very impersonal about it. It is another world,
and yet in it I recognise something, as though in a
dream.</p>

<p>We pass the Kennington "pub," Kennington
Cross, Chester Street, where I used to sleep. The
same, but, like its brother landmarks, a bit more
dilapidated. There is the old tub outside the
stables where I used to wash. The same old tub,
a little more twisted.</p>

<p>I tell the driver to pull up again. "Wait a
moment." I do not know why, but I want to get
out and walk. An automobile has no place in this
setting. I have no particular place to go. I just
walk along down Chester Street. Children are
playing, lovely children. I see myself among them
back there in the past. I wonder if any of them
will come back some day and look around enviously
at other children.</p>

<p>Somehow they seem different from those children
with whom I used to play. Sweeter, more dainty
were these little, begrimed kids with their arms
entwined around one another's waists. Others,
little girls mostly, sitting on the doorsteps, with
dolls, with sewing, all playing at that universal
game of "mothers."</p>

<p>For some reason I feel choking up. As I pass
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
they look up. Frankly and without embarrassment
they look at the stranger with their beautiful,
kindly eyes. They smile at me. I smile back.
Oh, if I could only do something for them. These
waifs with scarcely any chance at all.</p>

<p>Now a woman passes with a can of beer. With
a white skirt hanging down, trailing at the back.
She treads on it. There, she has done it again. I
want to shriek with laughter at the joy of being in
this same old familiar Kennington. I love it.</p>

<p>It is all so soft, so musical; there is so much affection
in the voices. They seem to talk from their
souls. There are the inflections that carry meanings,
even if words were not understood. I think
of Americans and myself. Our speech is hard,
monotonous, except where excitement makes it
more noisy.</p>

<p>There is a barber shop where I used to be the
lather boy. I wonder if the same old barber is still
there? I look. No, he is gone. I see two or
three kiddies playing on the porch. Foolish, I give
them something. It creates attention. I am about
to be discovered.</p>

<p>I leap into the taxi again and ride on. We drive
around until I have escaped from the neighbourhood
where suspicion has been planted and come
to the beginning of Lambeth Walk. I get out and
walk along among the crowds.</p>

<p>People are shopping. How lovely the cockneys
are! How romantic the figures, how sad, how
fascinating! Their lovely eyes. How patient they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
are! Nothing conscious about them. No affectation,
just themselves, their beautifully gay selves,
serene in their limitations, perfect in their type.</p>

<p>I am the wrong note in this picture that nature
has concentrated here. My clothes are a bit conspicuous
in this setting, no matter how unobtrusive
my thoughts and actions. Dressed as I am, one
never strolls along Lambeth Walk.</p>

<p>I feel the attention I am attracting. I put my
handkerchief to my face. People are looking at
me, at first slyly, then insistently. Who am I?
For a moment I am caught unawares.</p>

<p>A girl comes up&mdash;thin, narrow-chested, but with
an eagerness in her eyes that lifts her above any
physical defects.</p>

<p>"Charlie, don't you know me?"</p>

<p>Of course I know her. She is all excited, out of
breath. I can almost feel her heart thumping with
emotion as her narrow chest heaves with her hurried
breathing. Her face is ghastly white, a girl about
twenty-eight. She has a little girl with her.</p>

<p>This girl was a little servant girl who used to wait
on us at the cheap lodging-house where I lived.
I remembered that she had left in disgrace. There
was tragedy in it. But I could detect a certain
savage gloriousness in her. She was carrying on
with all odds against her. Hers is the supreme
battle of our age. May she and all others of her
kind meet a kindly fate.</p>

<p>With pent-up feelings we talk about the most
commonplace things.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, how are you, Charlie?"</p>

<p>"Fine." I point to the little girl. "Is she
your little girl?"</p>

<p>She says, "Yes."</p>

<p>That's all, but there doesn't seem to be much need
of conversation. We just look and smile at each
other and we both weave the other's story hurriedly
through our own minds by way of the heart.
Perhaps in our weaving we miss a detail or two, but
substantially we are right. There is warmth in the
renewed acquaintance. I feel that in this moment
I know her better than I ever did in the many
months I used to see her in the old days. And right
now I feel that she is worth knowing.</p>

<p>There's a crowd gathering. It's come. I am
discovered, with no chance for escape. I give the
girl some money to buy something for the child,
and hurry on my way. She understands and smiles.
Crowds are following. I am discovered in
Lambeth Walk.</p>

<p>But they are so charming about it. I walk along
and they keep behind at an almost standard distance.
I can feel rather than hear their shuffling
footsteps as they follow along, getting no closer,
losing no ground. It reminds me of the Pied
Piper of Hamelin.</p>

<p>All these people just about five yards away, all
timid, thrilled, excited at hearing my name, but not
having the courage to shout it under this spell.</p>

<p>"There he is." "That's 'im." All in
whispers hoarse with excitement and carrying for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
great distance, but at the same time repressed by
the effort of whispering. What manners these
cockneys have! The crowds accumulate. I am
getting very much concerned. Sooner or later they
are going to come up, and I am alone, defenceless.
What folly this going out alone, and along Lambeth
Walk!</p>

<p>Eventually I see a bobby, a sergeant&mdash;or, rather,
I think him one, he looks so immaculate in his uniform.
I go to him for protection.</p>

<p>"Do you mind?" I say. "I find I have been
discovered. I am Charlie Chaplin. Would you
mind seeing me to a taxi?"</p>

<p>"That's all right, Charlie. These people won't
hurt you. They are the best people in the world.
I have been with them for fifteen years." He
speaks with a conviction that makes me feel silly
and deservedly rebuked.</p>

<p>I say, "I know it; they are perfectly charming."</p>

<p>"That's just it," he answers. "They are
charming and nice."</p>

<p>They had hesitated to break in upon my solitude,
but now, sensing that I have protection, they speak
out.</p>

<p>"Hello, Charlie!" "God bless you, Charlie!"
"Good luck to you, lad!" As each flings his or
her greetings they smile and self-consciously back
away into the group, bringing others to the fore for
their greeting. All of them have a word&mdash;old
women, men, children. I am almost overcome
with the sincerity of their welcome.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<p>We are moving along and come to a street corner
and into Kennington Road again. The crowds
continue following as though I were their leader,
with nobody daring to approach within a certain
radius.</p>

<p>The little cockney children circle around me to
get a view from all sides.</p>

<p>I see myself among them. I, too, had followed
celebrities in my time in Kennington. I, too, had
pushed, edged, and fought my way to the front rank
of crowds, led by curiosity. They are in rags, the
same rags, only more ragged.</p>

<p>They are looking into my face and smiling, showing
their blackened teeth. Good God! English
children's teeth are terrible! Something can and
should be done about it. But their eyes!</p>

<p>Soulful eyes with such a wonderful expression.
I see a young girl glance slyly at her beau. What
a beautiful look she gives him! I find myself
wondering if he is worthy, if he realises the treasure
that is his. What a lovely people!</p>

<p>We are waiting. The policeman is busy hailing
a taxi. I just stand there self-conscious. Nobody
asks any questions. They are content to look.
Their steadfast watching is so impressing. I feel
small&mdash;like a cheat. Their worship does not belong
to me. God, if I could only do something for all
of them!</p>

<p>But there are too many&mdash;too many. Good
impulses so often die before this "too many."</p>

<p>I am in the taxi.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span></p>

<p>"Good-bye, Charlie! God bless you!" I am
on my way.</p>

<p>The taxi is going up Kennington Road along
Kennington Park. Kennington Park. How
depressing Kennington Park is! How depressing
to me are all parks! The loneliness of
them. One never goes to a park unless one is lonesome.
And lonesomeness is sad. The symbol of
sadness, that's a park.</p>

<p>But I am fascinated now with it. I am lonesome
and want to be. I want to commune with myself
and the years that are gone. The years that were
passed in the shadow of this same Kennington Park.
I want to sit on its benches again in spite of their
treacherous bleakness, in spite of the drabness.</p>

<p>But I am in a taxi. And taxis move fast. The
park is out of sight. Its alluring spell is dismissed
with its passing. I did not sit on the bench. We
are driving toward Kennington Gate.</p>

<p>Kennington Gate. That has its memories. Sad,
sweet, rapidly recurring memories.</p>

<p>'Twas here, my first appointment with Hetty
(Sonny's sister). How I was dolled up in my little,
tight-fitting frock coat, hat, and cane! I was quite
the dude as I watched every street car until four
o'clock waiting for Hetty to step off, smiling as she
saw me waiting.</p>

<p>I get out and stand there for a few moments at
Kennington Gate. My taxi driver thinks I am
mad. But I am forgetting taxi drivers. I am seeing
a lad of nineteen, dressed to the pink, with fluttering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
heart, waiting, waiting for the moment of the
day when he and happiness walked along the road.
The road is so alluring now. It beckons for another
walk, and as I hear a street car approaching I turn
eagerly, for the moment almost expecting to see
the same trim Hetty step off, smiling.</p>

<p>The car stops. A couple of men get off. An
old woman. Some children. But no Hetty.</p>

<p>Hetty is gone. So is the lad with the frock coat
and cane.</p>

<p>Back into the cab, we drive up Brixton Road.
We pass Glenshore Mansions&mdash;a more prosperous
neighbourhood. Glenshore Mansions, which meant
a step upward to me, where I had my Turkish
carpets and my red lights in the beginning of my
prosperity.</p>

<p>We pull up at The Horns for a drink. The same
Horns. Used to adjoin the saloon bar. It has
changed. Its arrangement is different. I do not
recognise the keeper. I feel very much the
foreigner now; do not know what to order. I am
out of place. There's a barmaid.</p>

<p>How strange, this lady with the coiffured hair
and neat little shirtwaist!</p>

<p>"What can I do for you, sir?"</p>

<p>I am swept off my feet. Impressed. I want to
feel very much the foreigner. I find myself acting.</p>

<p>"What have you got?"</p>

<p>She looks surprised.</p>

<p>"Ah, give me ginger beer." I find myself
becoming a little bit affected. I refuse to understand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
the money&mdash;the shillings and the pence. It
is thoroughly explained to me as each piece is
counted before me. I go over each one separately
and then leave it all on the table.</p>

<p>There are two women seated at a near-by table.
One is whispering to the other. I am recognised.</p>

<p>"That's 'im; I tell you 'tis."</p>

<p>"Ah, get out! And wot would 'e be a-doin'
'ere?"</p>

<p>I pretend not to hear, not to notice. But it is too
ominous. Suddenly a white funk comes over me
and I rush out and into the taxi again. It's closing
time for a part of the afternoon. Something
different. I am surprised. It makes me think it
is Sunday. Then I learn that it is a new rule in
effect since the war.</p>

<p>I am driving down Kennington Road again.
Passing Kennington Cross.</p>

<p>Kennington Cross.</p>

<p>It was here that I first discovered music, or where
I first learned its rare beauty, a beauty that has
gladdened and haunted me from that moment. It
all happened one night while I was there, about
midnight. I recall the whole thing so distinctly.</p>

<p>I was just a boy, and its beauty was like some
sweet mystery. I did not understand. I only
knew I loved it and I became reverent as the sounds
carried themselves through my brain <i>via</i> my heart.</p>

<p>I suddenly became aware of a harmonica and a
clarinet playing a weird, harmonious message. I
learned later that it was "The Honeysuckle and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
the Bee." It was played with such feeling that I
became conscious for the first time of what melody
really was. My first awakening to music.</p>

<p>I remembered how thrilled I was as the sweet
sounds pealed into the night. I learned the words
the next day. How I would love to hear it now,
that same tune, that same way!</p>

<p>Conscious of it, yet defiant, I find myself singing
the refrain softly to myself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>You are the honey, honeysuckle. I am the bee;</p>
<p>I'd like to sip the honey, dear, from those red lips. You see</p>
<p>I love you dearie, dearie, and I want you to love me&mdash;</p>
<p>You are my honey, honeysuckle. I am your bee.</p>
</div></div>

<p>Kennington Cross, where music first entered my
soul. Trivial, perhaps, but it was the first time.</p>

<p>There are a few stragglers left as I pass on my
way along Manchester Bridge at the Prince Road.
They are still watching me. I feel that Kennington
Road is alive to the fact that I am in it. I am
hoping that they are feeling that I have come back,
not that I am a stranger in the public eye.</p>

<p>I am on my way back. Crossing Westminster
Bridge. I enter a new land. I go back to the
Haymarket, back to the Ritz to dress for dinner.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span></p>

<h2>VII.<br />
<br />
A JOKE AND STILL ON THE GO</h2>

<p class="p2">In the evening I dined at the Ritz with Ed.
Knoblock, Miss Forrest, and several other
friends. The party was a very congenial one and
the dinner excellent. It did much to lift me from
the depression into which the afternoon in Kennington
had put me.</p>

<p>Following dinner we said "Good night" to
Miss Forrest, and the rest of us went around to Ed.
Knoblock's apartment in the Albany. The Albany
is the most interesting building I have yet visited
in London.</p>

<p>In a sort of dignified grandeur it stands swathed
in an atmosphere of tradition. It breathes the past,
and such a past! It has housed men like Shelley
and Edmund Burke and others whose fame is linked
closely with the march of English civilisation.</p>

<p>Naturally, the building is very old. Ed.'s
apartment commands a wonderful view of London.
It is beautifully and artistically furnished, its high
ceilings, its tapestries, and its old Victorian windows
giving it a quaintness rather startling in this modern
age.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span></p>

<p>We had a bit of supper, and about eleven-thirty
it began to rain, and later there was a considerable
thunderstorm.</p>

<p>Conversation, languishing on general topics,
turns to me, the what and wherefore of my coming
and going, my impressions, plans, etc. I tell them
as best I can.</p>

<p>Knoblock is anxious to get my views on England,
on the impression that London has made. We
discuss the matter and make comparisons. I feel
that England has acquired a sadness, something
that is tragic and at the same time beautiful.</p>

<p>We discuss my arrival. How wonderful it was.
The crowds, the reception. Knoblock thinks that
it is the apex of my career. I am inclined to agree
with him.</p>

<p>Whereupon Tom Geraghty comes forward with a
startling thought. Tom suggests that I die immediately.
He insists that this is the only fitting thing
to do, that to live after such a reception and ovation
would be an anti-climax. The artistic thing to do
would be to finish off my career with a spectacular
death. Everyone is shocked at his suggestion.
But I agree with Tom that it would be a great
climax. We are all becoming very sentimental;
we insist to one another that we must not think
such thoughts, and the like.</p>

<p>The lightning is flashing fitfully outside. Knoblock,
with an inspiration, gathers all of us, except
Tom Geraghty, into a corner and suggests that on
the next flash of lightning, just for a joke, I pretend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
to be struck dead, to see what effect it would have
on Tom.</p>

<p>We make elaborate plans rapidly. Each is
assigned to his part in the impromptu tragedy. We
give Tom another drink and start to talking about
death and kindred things. Then we all comment
how the wind is shaking this old building, how its
windows rattle and the weird effect that lightning
has on its old tapestries and lonely candlesticks.
Surreptitiously, some one has turned out all but one
light, but old Tom does not suspect.</p>

<p>The atmosphere is perfect for our hoax and
several of us who are "in the know" feel sort of
creepy as we wait for the next flash. I prime
myself for the bit of acting.</p>

<p>The flash comes, and with it I let forth a horrible
shriek, then stand up, stiffen, and fall flat on my
face. I think I did it rather well, and I am not
sure but that others beside Tom were frightened.</p>

<p>Tom drops his whisky glass and exclaims: "My
God! It's happened!" and his voice is sober. But
no one pays any attention to him.</p>

<p>They all rush to me and I am carried feet first into
the bedroom, and the door closed on poor old Tom,
who is trying to follow me in. Tom just paces the
floor, waiting for some one to come from the bedroom
and tell him what has happened. He
knocks on the door several times, but no one
will let him in.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_100" id="i_100"></a>
<img src="images/i_100.jpg" width="369" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">My "property grin."</p>
</div>

<p>Finally, Carl Robinson comes out of the room,
looking seriously intent, and Tom rushes to him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>

<p>"For God's sake, Carl, what's wrong?"</p>

<p>Carl brushes him aside and makes for the telephone.</p>

<p>"Is he&mdash;dead?" Tom puts the question
huskily and fearfully.</p>

<p>Carl pays no attention except: "Please don't
bother me now, Tom. This is too serious."
Then he calls on the telephone for the coroner.
This has such an effect on Geraghty that Knoblock
comes forth from the bedroom to pacify him.</p>

<p>"I am sure it will be all right," Knoblock says
to Tom, at the same time looking as though he were
trying to keep something secret. Everything is
staged perfectly and poor old Tom just stands and
looks bewildered, and every few moments tries to
break into the bedroom, but is told to stay out, that
he is in no condition to be mixing up in anything so
serious.</p>

<p>The chief of police is called, doctors are urged to
rush there in all haste with motors, and with
each call Tom's suffering increases. We keep up
the joke until it has reached the point of artistry,
and then I enter from the bedroom in a flowing sheet
for a gown and a pillow slip on each arm to represent
wings, and I proceed to be an angel for a moment.</p>

<p>But the effect has been too great on Tom, and
even the travesty at the finish does not get a laugh
from him.</p>

<p>We laughed and talked about the stunt for a while
and Tom was asked what he would have done if it
had been true and I had been hit by the lightning.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>

<p>Tom made me feel very cheap and sorry that I
had played the trick on him when he said that he
would have jumped out of the window himself, as
he would have no desire to live if I were dead.</p>

<p>But we soon got away from serious things and
ended the party merrily and went home about five in
the morning. Which meant that we would sleep
very late that day.</p>

<p>Three o'clock in the afternoon found me
awakened by the news that there was a delegation
of reporters waiting to see me. They were all
ushered in and the whole thirty-five of them started
firing questions at me in a bunch. And I answered
them all, for by this time I was quite proficient with
reporters, and as they all asked the same questions
that I had answered before it was not hard.</p>

<p>In fact, we all had luncheon or tea together,
though for me it was breakfast, and I enjoyed them
immensely. They are real, sincere, and intelligent
and not hero worshippers.</p>

<p>Along about five o'clock Ed. Knoblock came in
with the suggestion that we go out for a ride
together and call around to see Bernard Shaw. This
did sound like a real treat. Knoblock knows Shaw
very well and he felt sure that Shaw and I would
like each other.</p>

<p>First, though, I propose that we take a ride about
London, and Ed. leads the way to some very
interesting spots, the spots that the tourist rarely
sees as he races his way through the buildings listed
in guide books.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span></p>

<p>He takes me to the back of the Strand Theatre,
where there are beautiful gardens and courts suggesting
palaces and armour and the days when
knights were bold. These houses were the homes
of private people during the reign of King Charles
and even farther back. They abound in secret
passages and tunnels leading up to the royal
palace. There is an air about them that is aped
and copied, but it is not hard to distinguish the real
from the imitation. History is written on every
stone; not the history of the battlefield that is laid
bare for the historians, but that more intimate history,
that of the drawing-room, where, after all,
the real ashes of empires are sifted.</p>

<p>Now we are in Adelphi Terrace, where Bernard
Shaw and Sir James Barrie live. What a lovely
place the terrace is! And its arches underneath
leading to the river. And at this hour, six-thirty,
there comes the first fall of evening and London with
its soft light is at its best.</p>

<p>I can quite understand why Whistler was so crazy
about it. Its lighting is perfect&mdash;so beautiful and
soft. Perhaps there are those who complain that
it is poorly lighted and who would install many
modern torches of electricity to remedy the defect,
but give me London as it is. Do not paint the lily.</p>

<p>We make for Shaw's house, which overlooks the
Thames Embankment. As we approach I feel
that this is a momentous occasion. I am to meet
Shaw. We reach the house. I notice on the
door a little brass name plate with the inscription,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
"Bernard Shaw." I wonder if there is anything
significant about Shaw's name being engraved in
brass. The thought pleases me. But we are here,
and Knoblock is about to lift the knocker.</p>

<p>And then I seem to remember reading somewhere
about dozens of movie actors going abroad,
and how they invariably visited Shaw. Good Lord!
the man must be weary of them. And why should
he be singled out and imposed upon? And I do
not desire to ape others. And I want to be individual
and different. And I want Bernard Shaw to
like me. And I don't want to force myself upon
him.</p>

<p>And all this is occurring very rapidly, and I am
getting fussed, and we are almost before him, and
I say to Knoblock, "No, I don't want to meet
him."</p>

<p>Ed. is annoyed and surprised and thinks I am
crazy and everything. He asks why, and I suddenly
become embarrassed and shy. "Some other
time," I beg. "We won't call to-day." I don't
know why, but suddenly I feel self-conscious and
silly&mdash;</p>

<p>Would I care to see Barrie? He lives just across
the road.</p>

<p>"No, I don't want to see any of them to-day."
I am too tired. I find that it would be too much
effort.</p>

<p>So I go home, after drinking in all the beauties
of the evening, the twilight, and the loveliness of
Adelphi Terrace. This requires no effort. I can
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
just drift along on my own, let thoughts come and
go as they will, and never have to think about being
polite and wondering if I am holding my own in
intelligent discussion that is sure to arise when one
meets great minds. I wasted the evening just then.
Some other time, I know, I am going to want Shaw
and Barrie.</p>

<p>I drift along with the sight and am carried back a
hundred years, two hundred, a thousand. I seem
to see the ghosts of King Charles and others of Old
England with the tombstones epitaphed in Old
English and dating back even to the eleventh century.</p>

<p>It is all fragrant and too fleeting. We must get
back to the hotel to dress for dinner.</p>

<p>Then Knoblock, Sonny, Geraghty, and a few
others dine with me at the Embassy Club, but
Knoblock, who is tired, leaves after dinner. Along
about ten o'clock Sonny, Geraghty, Donald Crist,
Carl Robinson, and myself decide to take a ride.
We make toward Lambeth. I want to show them
Lambeth. I feel as if it is mine&mdash;a choice discovery
and possession that I wish to display.</p>

<p>I recall an old photographer's shop in the Westminster
Bridge Road just before you come to the
bridge. I want to see it again. We get out there.
I remember having seen a picture framed in that
window when I was a boy&mdash;a picture of Dan Leno,
who was an idol of mine in those days.</p>

<p>The picture was still there, so is the photographer&mdash;the
name "Sharp" is still on the shop. I tell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
my friends that I had my picture taken here about
fifteen years ago, and we went inside to see if we
could get one of the photos.</p>

<p>"My name is Chaplin," I told the person
behind the counter. "You photographed me
fifteen years ago. I want to buy some copies."</p>

<p>"Oh, we destroyed the negative long ago," the
person behind the counter thus dismisses me.</p>

<p>"Have you destroyed Mr. Leno's negative?" I
ask him.</p>

<p>"No," was the reply, "but Mr. Leno is a
famous comedian."</p>

<p>Such is fame. Here I had been patting myself on
the back, thinking I was some pumpkins as a comedian,
and my negative destroyed. However, there
is balm in Gilead. I tell him I am Charlie Chaplin
and he wants to turn the place upside down to get
some new pictures of me; but we haven't the time,
and, besides, I want to get out, because I am hearing
suppressed snickers from my friends, before
whom I was going to show off.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span></p>

<h2>VIII.<br />
<br />
A MEMORABLE NIGHT IN LONDON</h2>

<p class="p2">So we wandered along through South London
by Kennington Cross and Kennington Gate,
Newington Butts, Lambeth Walk, and the
Clapham Road, and all through the neighbourhood.
Almost every step brought back memories, most of
them of a tender sort. I was right here in the
midst of my youth, but somehow I seemed apart
from it. I felt as though I was viewing it under a
glass. It could be seen all too plainly, but when I
reached to touch it it was not there&mdash;only the glass
could be felt, this glass that had been glazed by the
years since I left.</p>

<p>If I could only get through the glass and touch
the real live thing that had called me back to
London. But I couldn't.</p>

<p>A man cannot go back. He thinks he can, but
other things have happened to his life. He has
new ideas, new friends, new attachments. He
doesn't belong to his past, except that the past has,
perhaps, made marks on him.</p>

<p>My friends and I continue our stroll&mdash;a stroll so
pregnant with interest to me at times that I forget
that I have company and wander along alone.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span></p>

<p>Who is that old derelict there against the cart?
Another landmark. I look at him closely. He is
the same&mdash;only more so. Well do I remember
him, the old tomato man. I was about twelve when
I first saw him, and he is still here in the same old
spot, plying the same old trade, while I&mdash;</p>

<p>I can picture him as he first appeared to me
standing beside his round cart heaped with
tomatoes, his greasy clothes shiny in their unkemptness,
the rather glassy single eye that had looked
from one side of his face staring at nothing in particular,
but giving you the feeling that it was seeing
all, the bottled nose with the network of veins spelling
dissipation.</p>

<p>I remember how I used to stand around and wait
for him to shout his wares. His method never
varied. There was a sudden twitching convulsion,
and he leaned to one side, trying to straighten out
the other as he did so, and then, taking into his
one good lung all the air it would stand, he would
let forth a clattering, gargling, asthmatic, high-pitched
wheeze, a series of sounds which defied
interpretation.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the explosion there could be detected
"ripe tomatoes." Any other part of his
message was lost.</p>

<p>And he was still here. Through summer suns
and winter snows he had stood and was standing.
Only a bit more decrepit, a bit older, more
dyspeptic, his clothes greasier, his shoulder
rounder, his one eye rather filmy and not so all-seeing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
as it once was. And I waited. But he did
not shout his wares any more. Even the good lung
was failing. He just stood there inert in his ageing.
And somehow the tomatoes did not look so good as
they once were.</p>

<p>We get into a cab and drive back towards Brixton
to the Elephant and Castle, where we pull up at a
coffee store. The same old London coffee store,
with its bad coffee and tea.</p>

<p>There are a few pink-cheeked roués around and
a couple of old derelicts. Then there are a lot of
painted ladies, many of them with young men and
the rest of them looking for young men. Some of
the young fellows are minus arms and many of them
carry various ribbons of military honour. They are
living and eloquent evidence of the War and its
effects. There are a number of stragglers. The
whole scene to me is depressing. What a sad
London this is! People with tired, worn faces
after four years of War!</p>

<p>Someone suggests that we go up and see George
Fitzmaurice, who lives in Park Lane. There we
can get a drink and then go to bed. We jump in a
cab and are soon there. What a difference! Park
Lane is another world after the Elephant and
Castle. Here are the homes of the millionaires and
the prosperous.</p>

<p>Fitzmaurice is quite a successful moving-picture
director. We find a lot of friends at his house, and
over whiskies-and-sodas we discuss our trip. Our
trip through Kennington suggests Limehouse, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
conversation turns toward that district and Thomas
Burke.</p>

<p>I get their impressions of Limehouse. It is not
as tough as it has been pictured. I rather lost my
temper through the discussion.</p>

<p>One of those in the party, an actor, spoke very
sneeringly of that romantic district and its people.</p>

<p>"Talk about Limehouse nights. I thought
they were tough down there. Why, they are
like a lot of larks!" said this big-muscled leading
man.</p>

<p>And then he tells of a visit to the Limehouse
district&mdash;a visit made solely for the purpose of
finding trouble. How he had read of the tough
characters there and how he had decided to go down
to find out how tough they were.</p>

<p>"I went right down there into their joints," he
said, "and told them that I was looking for somebody
that was tough, the tougher the better, and
I went up to a big mandarin wearing a feather and
said: 'Give me the toughest you've got. You
fellows are supposed to be tough down here, so
let's see how tough you are.' And I couldn't get
a rise out of any of them," he concluded.</p>

<p>This was enough for me. It annoyed.</p>

<p>I told him that it was very fine for well-fed, over-paid
actors flaunting toughness at these deprived
people, who are gentle and nice and, if ever tough,
only so because of environment. I asked him just
how tough he would be if he were living the life
that some of these unfortunate families must live.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
How easy for him, with five meals a day beneath
that thrust-out chest with his muscles trained and
perfect, trying to start something with these people.
Of course they were not tough, but when it comes
to four years of War, when it comes to losing an
arm or a leg, then they are tough. But they are not
going around looking for fights unless there is a
reason.</p>

<p>It rather broke up the party, but I was feeling so
disgusted that I did not care.</p>

<p>We meander along, walking from Park Lane to
the Ritz.</p>

<p>On our way we are stopped by two or three young
girls. They are stamped plainly and there is no
subtlety about their "Hello boys! You are not
going home so early?" They salute us. We
wait a moment. They pause and then wave their
hands to us and we beckon them.</p>

<p>"How is it you are up so late?" They are
plainly embarrassed at this question. Perhaps it
has been a long time since they were given the
benefit of the doubt. They are not sure just what
to say. We are different. Their usual method of
attack or caress does not seem in order, so they
just giggle.</p>

<p>Here is life in its elemental rawness. I feel very
kindly disposed toward them, particularly after my
bout with the well-fed actor who got his entertainment
from the frailties of others. But it is rather
hard for us to mix. There is a rather awkward
silence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<p>Then one of the girls asks if we have a cigarette.
Robinson gives them a package, which they share
between the three of them. This breaks the
ice. They feel easier. The meeting is beginning
to run along the parliamentary rules that they
know.</p>

<p>Do we know where they can get a drink?</p>

<p>"No." This is a temporary setback, but they
ask if we mind their walking along a bit with us.
We don't, and we walk along towards the Ritz.
They are giggling, and before long I am recognised.
They are embarrassed.</p>

<p>They look down at their shabby little feet where
ill-fitting shoes run over at the heels. Their cheap
little cotton suits class them even low in their profession,
though their youth is a big factor toward
their potential rise when they have become
hardened and their mental faculties have become
sharpened in their eternal battles with men. Then
men will come to them.</p>

<p>Knowing my identity, they are on their good
behaviour. No longer are we prospects. We are
true adventure for them this night. Their intimacy
has left them and in its place there appears a reserve
which is attractive even in its awkwardness.</p>

<p>The conversation becomes somewhat formal.
And we are nearing the hotel, where we must leave
them. They are very nice and charming now, and
are as timid and reserved as though they had just
left a convent.</p>

<p>They talk haltingly of the pictures they have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
seen, shyly telling how they loved me in "Shoulder
Arms," while one of them told how she wept when
she saw "The Kid" and how she had that night
sent some money home to a little kid brother who
was in school and staying there through her efforts
in London.</p>

<p>The difference in them seems so marked when
they call me Mr. Chaplin and I recall how they had
hailed us as "Hello, boys." Somehow I rather
resent the change. I wish they would be more
intimate in their conversation. I would like to get
their viewpoint. I want to talk to them freely.
They are so much more interesting than most of
the people I meet.</p>

<p>But there is a barrier. Their reserve stays. I
told them that I was sure they were tired and gave
them cab fare.</p>

<p>One of their number speaks for the trio.</p>

<p>"Thanks, Mr. Chaplin, very much. I could
do with this, really. I was broke, honest. Really,
this comes in very handy."</p>

<p>They could not quite understand our being nice
and sympathetic.</p>

<p>They were used to being treated in the jocular
way of street comradery. Finer qualities came
forward under the respectful attention we gave
them, something rather nice that had been buried
beneath the veneer of their trade.</p>

<p>Their thanks are profuse, yet awkward. They
are not used to giving thanks. They usually pay,
and pay dearly, for anything handed them. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
bid them "good night." They smile and walk
away.</p>

<p>We watch them for a bit as they go on their way.
At first they are strolling along, chattering about
their adventure. Then, as if on a signal, they
straighten up as though bracing themselves, and
with quickened steps they move toward Piccadilly,
where a haze of light is reflected against the murky
sky.</p>

<p>It is the beacon light from their battleground,
and as we follow them with our eyes these butterflies
of the night make for the lights where there is
laughter and gaiety.</p>

<p>As we go along to the Ritz we are all sobered
by the encounter with the three little girls. I think
blessed is the ignorance that enables them to go on
without the mental torture that would come from
knowing the inevitable that awaits them.</p>

<p>As we go up the steps of the hotel we see a
number of derelicts huddled asleep against the outside
of the building, sitting under the arches and
doors, men and women, old and young, underfed,
deprived, helpless, so much so that the imprint of
helplessness is woven into their brain and brings on
an unconsciousness that is a blessing.</p>

<p>We wake them up and hand them each money.
"Here, get yourself a bed."</p>

<p>They are too numbed. They thank us
mechanically, accepting what we give them, but
their reaction and thanks are more physical than
mental.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span></p>

<p>There was one old woman about seventy. I
gave her something. She woke up, or stirred in
her sleep, took the money without a word of thanks&mdash;took
it as though it was her ration from the bread
line and no thanks were expected, huddled herself
up in a tighter knot than before, and continued
her slumber. The inertia of poverty had long
since claimed her.</p>

<p>We rang the night bell at the Ritz, for they are
not like our American hotels, where guests are in
the habit of coming in at all hours of the night.
The Ritz closes its doors at midnight, and after that
hour you must ring them.</p>

<p>But the night was not quite over. As we were
ringing the bell we noticed a waggon a little way
off in the street, with the horse slipping and the
driver out behind the waggon with his shoulder to
the wheel and urging the horse along with cheery
words.</p>

<p>We walked to the waggon and found it was
loaded with apples and on its way to the market.
The streets were so slippery that the horse could
not negotiate the hill. I could not help but
think how different from the usual driver this man
was.</p>

<p>He did not belay the tired animal with a whip
and curse and swear at him in his helplessness.
He saw that the animal was up against it, and
instead of beating him he got out and put his
shoulder to the wheel, never for the moment doubting
that the horse was doing his best.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>

<p>We all went out into the street and put our
shoulders against the waggon along with the driver.
He thanked us, and as we finally got the momentum
necessary to carry it over the hill he said:</p>

<p>"These darn roads are so slippery that the
darned horse even can't pull it."</p>

<p>It was a source of wonder to him that he should
come upon something too much for his horse. And
the horse was so well fed and well kept. I could
not help but notice how much better the animal
looked than his master. The evening was over.
I don't know but that the incident of the apple
waggon was a fitting finale.</p>

<p>The next morning for the first time I am made
to give my attention to the mail that has been
arriving. We have been obliged to have another
room added to our suite in order to have some place
in which to keep the numerous sacks that are being
brought to us at all hours.</p>

<p>The pile is becoming so mountainous that we are
compelled to engage half a dozen stenographers
just for the purpose of reading and classifying them.</p>

<p>We found that there were 73,000 letters or cards
addressed to me during the first three days in
London, and of this number more than 28,000 were
begging letters&mdash;letters begging anywhere from £1
to £100,000.</p>

<p>Countless and varied were the reasons set forth.
Some were ridiculous. Some were amusing.
Some were pathetic. Some were insulting. All
of them in earnest.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span></p>

<p>I discovered from the mail that there are 671
relatives of mine in England that I knew nothing
about.</p>

<p>The greater part of these were cousins, and they
gave very detailed family-tree tracings in support of
their claims. All of them wished to be set up in
business or to get into the movies.</p>

<p>But the cousins did not have a monopoly on the
relationships. There were brothers and sisters
and aunts and uncles, and there were nine claiming
to be my mother, telling wondrous adventure
stories about my being stolen by gipsies when a
baby or being left on doorsteps, until I began to
think my youth had been a very hectic affair. But
I did not worry much about these last, as I had
left a perfectly good mother back in California,
and so far I have been pretty much satisfied with
her.</p>

<p>There were letters addressed just to Charles
Chaplin, some to King Charles, some to the "King
of Mirth"; on some there was drawn the picture
of a battered derby; some carried a reproduction
of my shoes and cane; and in some there was stuck
a white feather with the question as to what I was
doing during the war?</p>

<p>Would I visit such and such institutions?
Would I appear for such and such charity?
Would I kick off the football season or attend some
particular Soccer game? Then there were letters
of welcome and one enclosing an iron cross
inscribed, "For your services in the Great War,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
and "Where were you when England was
fighting?"</p>

<p>Then there were others thanking me for happiness
given the senders. These came by the
thousand. One young soldier sent me four medals
he had gotten during the big war. He said that he
was sending them because I had never been
properly recognised. His part was so small
and mine so big, he said, that he wanted me to
have his <i>Croix de Guerre</i>, his regimental and other
medals.</p>

<p>Some of the letters were most interesting. Here
are a few samples:</p>

<div class="blockquot p2">
<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Chaplin</span>,&mdash;You are a leader in your line
and I am a leader in mine. Your speciality is moving
pictures and custard pies. My speciality is windmills.</p>

<p>I know more about windmills than any man in the
world. I have studied the winds all over the world
and am now in a position to invent a windmill that
will be the standard mill of the world, and it will be
made so it can be adapted to the winds of the tropics
and the winds of the arctic regions.</p>

<p>I am going to let you in on this in an advantageous
way. You have only to furnish the money. I have the
brains, and in a few years I will make you rich and
famous. You had better 'phone me for quick action.
</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot p2">
<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Chaplin</span>,&mdash;Won't you please let me have
enough money to send little Oscar to college? Little
Oscar is twelve, and the neighbours all say that he is
the brightest little boy they have ever seen. And he
can imitate you so well that we don't have to go to
the movies any more. [This is dangerous. Oscar is a
real competitor, ruining my business.] And so, if you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
can't send the little fellow to college, won't you take
him in the movies with you like you did Jackie Coogan?
</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot p2">
<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Chaplin</span>,&mdash;My brother is a sailor, and he
is the only man in the world who knows where Capt.
Kidd's gold is buried. He has charts and maps and
everything necessary, including a pick and shovel.
But he cannot pay for the boat.</p>

<p>Will you pay for the boat, and half the gold is yours?
All you need do is to say "yes" to me in a letter, and
I will go out and look for John as he is off somewhere
on a bust, being what you might call a drinking man
when ashore. But I am sure that I can find him, as
he and I drink in the same places. Your shipmate.
</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot p2">
<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Charlie</span>,&mdash;Have you ever thought of the
money to be made in peanuts? I know the peanut
industry, but I am not telling any of my business in
a letter. If you are interested in becoming a peanut
king, then I'm your man. Just address me as Snapper
Dodge, above address.
</p>
</div>

<div class="blockquot p2">
<p>
<span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Chaplin</span>,&mdash;My daughter has been helping
me about my boarding-house now for several years, and
I may say that she understands the art of catering to
the public as wishes to stay in quarters. But she has
such high-toned ideas, like as putting up curtains in
the bathroom and such that at times I think she is too
good for the boarding-house business and should be
having her own hotel to run.</p>

<p>If you could see your way to buy a hotel in London
or New York for Drusilla, I am sure that before long
your name and Drusilla's would be linked together all
over the world because of what Drusilla would do to
the hotel business. And she would save money because
she could make all the beds and cook herself, and at
nights could invent the touches like what I have
mentioned. Drusilla is waiting for you to call her.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot p2">
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Chaplin</span>,&mdash;I am enclosing pawn tickets for
Grandma's false teeth and our silver water pitcher, also
a rent bill showing that our rent was due yesterday.
Of course, we would rather have you pay our rent first,
but if you could spare it, grandma's teeth would be
acceptable, and we can't hold our heads up among the
neighbours since father sneaked our silver pitcher to get
some beer.</p>

<h2>IX.<br />
<br />
I MEET THE IMMORTALS</h2>

<p class="p2">Here are extracts from a number of letters
selected at random from the mountain of
mail awaiting me at the hotel:</p>

<p>"&mdash;&mdash; wishes Mr. Chaplin a hearty welcome and
begs him to give him the honour of shaving him on
Sunday, Sept. 11, any time which he thinks
suitable."</p>

<p>A West End moneylender has forwarded his
business card, which states: "Should you require
temporary cash accommodation, I am prepared to
advance you £50 to £10,000 on note of hand alone,
without fees or delay. All communications strictly
private and confidential."</p>

<p>A man living in Golden Square, W., writes:
"My son, in the endeavour to get a flower thrown
by you from the Ritz Hotel, lost his hat, the bill
for which I enclose, seven shillings and sixpence."</p>

<p>A Liverpool scalp specialist gathers that Mr.
Chaplin is much concerned regarding the appearance
of grey hairs in his head. "I claim to be,"
he adds, "the only man in Great Britain who can
and does restore the colour of grey hair. You may
visit Liverpool, and if you will call I shall be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>
pleased to examine your scalp and give you a
candid opinion. If nothing can be done I will state
so frankly."</p>

<p>"Is there any chance," writes a woman of
Brixton, "of you requiring for your films the services
of twin small boys nearly four years old and
nearly indistinguishable? An American agent has
recently been in this neighbourhood and secured a
contract with two such small girls (twins), which
points to at least a demand for such on American
films."</p>

<p>A widow of sixty-two writes: "I have a half-dozen
china teaset of the late Queen Victoria's
diamond jubilee, and it occurred to me that you
might like to possess it. If you would call or
allow me to take it anywhere for you to see,
I would gladly do so. I have had it twenty-four
years, and would like to raise money on it."</p>

<p>A South London picture dealer writes: "If
ever you should be passing this way when you are
taking your quiet strolls around London, I would
like you to drop in and see a picture that I think
might interest you. It is the Strand by night,
painted by Arthur Grimshaw in 1887. I hope you
won't think I have taken too much of a liberty&mdash;but
I knew your mother when I was in Kate
Paradise's troupe, and I think she would remember
me if ever you were to mention Clara Symonds of
that troupe. It is a little link with the past."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Old Friend</span>,&mdash;Some months ago I
wrote to you, and no doubt you will remember me.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
I was in 'Casey's Court,' and, as you know, we
had Mr. Murray for our boss. You have indeed
got on well. I myself have only this month come
home from being in Turkey for eight years. Dear
old boy, I should like to see you when you come to
London&mdash;that is, if you do not mind mixing with
one of the Casey's Court urchins."</p>

<p>A Sussex mother writes: "Would you grant a
few moments' interview to a little girl of nine (small
for her years) whom I am anxious to start on the
films? She has much in her favour, being not only
bright and clever, but unusually attractive in
appearance, receiving unlimited attention wherever
she goes, as she is really quite out of the ordinary."</p>

<p>A disengaged actress writes: "If you should
take a film in England it would be a great kindness
to employ some of the hundreds of actresses out of
work now and with no prospects of getting any.
A walk-on would be a very welcome change to
many of us, to say nothing of a part."</p>

<p>A Somerset man writes: "A friend of mine has
a very old-time spot right here in Somerset, with
the peacocks wandering across the well-kept
grounds and three lovely trout ponds, where last
night I brought home five very fine rainbow trout
each weighing about one-and-a-half pounds. You
will be tired of the crowds. Slip away down to me
and I will give you ten days or more of the best
time you can get. There will be no side or style,
and your oldest clothes will be the thing."</p>

<p>Another correspondent says: "My husband and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
I should consider it an honour if during your visit
to South London you would call and take a homely
cup of tea with us. I read in the paper of your
intention to stay at an old-fashioned inn, and should
like to recommend the White Horse Inn at Sheen,
which, I believe, is the oldest in Surrey. It certainly
corresponds with your ideal. Welcome to
your home town."</p>

<p>This from the seaside: "When you are really
tired of the rush of London there is a very nice little
place called Seaford, not very far from London, just
a small place where you can have a real rest. No
dressing up, etc., and then fishing, golf, and tennis
if you care for the same. You could put up at an
hotel or here. There will be no one to worry you.
Don't forget to drop us a line."</p>

<p>A London clubman, in offering hospitality, says:
"I do not know you. You do not know me, and
probably don't want to. But just think it over and
come and have a bit of lunch with me one day.
This between ourselves&mdash;no publicity."</p>

<p>"Saint Pancras Municipal Officers' Swimming
Club would be greatly honoured by your presiding
at our annual swimming gala to be held at the St.
Pancras Public Baths."</p>

<p>Dorothy, writing from Poplar, asks: "Dear
Mr. Charlie Chaplin, if you have a pair of old boots
at home will you throw them at me for luck?"</p>

<p>An aspirant for the position of secretary writes:
"I am a musical comedy artist by profession, but
am at present out of work. I am six feet two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
inches in height and 27 years of age. If there is
any capacity in which you can use my services I
shall be very thankful. Hoping you will have an
enjoyable stay in your home country."</p>

<p>A Barnes man writes: "If you have time we
should be very proud if you could spare an afternoon
to come to tea. We should love to give you a real
old-fashioned Scotch tea, if you would care to come.
We know you will be fêted, and everyone will want
you, but if you feel tired and want a wee rest come
out quietly to us. If it wasn't for your dear funny
ways on the screen during the war we would all
have gone under."</p>

<p>"Dear Charles," writes an eleven-year-old,
"I'd like to meet you very, very much. I'd like
to meet you just to say thank you for all the times
you've cheered me up when I've felt down and
miserable. I've never met you and I don't suppose
I ever will, but you will always be my friend
and helper. I'd love your photograph signed by
you! Are you likely to come to Harrogate? I
wish you would. Perhaps you could come and see
me. Couldn't you try?"</p>

<p>I wish I could read them all, for in every one
there is human feeling, and I wish it were possible
that I could accept some of the invitations, especially
those inviting me to quietness and solitude. But
there are thousands too many. Most of them will
have to be answered by my secretaries, but all of
them will be answered, and we are taking trunkfuls
of the letters back to California in order that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
as many of the requests as possible shall receive
attention.</p>

<p>During the afternoon there came Donald Crisp,
Tom Geraghty and the bunch, and before long my
apartment in the London Ritz might just as well be
home in Los Angeles. I realise that I am getting
nowhere, meeting nobody and still playing in Hollywood.</p>

<p>I have travelled 6,000 miles and find I have not
shaken the dust of Hollywood from my shoes. I
resent this. I tell Knoblock I must meet other
people besides Geraghty and the Hollywood bunch.
I have seen as much as I want to see of it. Now
I want to meet people.</p>

<p>Knoblock smiles, but he is too kind to remind
me of my retreat before the name plate of Bernard
Shaw. He and I go shopping and I am measured
for some clothes; then to lunch with E. V. Lucas.</p>

<p>Lucas is a very charming man, sympathetic and
sincere. He has written a number of very good
books. It is arranged to give me a party that night
at the Garrick Club.</p>

<p>After luncheon we visit Stoll's Theatre, where
"Shoulder Arms" and Mary Pickford's picture
"Suds," are being shown. This is my first
experience in an English cinema. The opera house
is one that was built by Steinhouse and then turned
into a movie theatre.</p>

<p>It is strange and odd to see the English audience
drinking tea and eating pastry while watching the
performance. I find very little difference in their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
appreciation of the picture. All the points tell
just the same as in America. I get out without
being recognised and am very thankful for that.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_129" id="i_129"></a>
<img src="images/i_129.jpg" width="550" height="308" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Another scene from "Sunnyside," one of my favourite photo plays.</p>
</div>

<p>Back to the hotel and rest for the evening before
my dinner at the Garrick Club.</p>

<p>The thought of dining at the Garrick Club
brought up before me the mental picture that I have
always carried of that famous old meeting place in
London, where Art is most dignified. And the
club itself realised my picture to the fullest.</p>

<p>Tradition and custom are so deep-rooted there
that I believe its routine would go on through sheer
mechanics of spirit, even if its various employees
should forget to show up some day. The corners
seem almost peopled with the ghosts of Henry
Irving and his comrades. There in one end of the
gloomy old room is a chair in which David Garrick
himself sat.</p>

<p>All those at the dinner were well known in art
circles&mdash;E. V. Lucas, Walter Hackett, George
Frampton, J. M. Barrie, Herbert Hammil,
Edward Knoblock, Harry Graham, N. Nicholas,
Nicholas D. Davies, Squire Bancroft, and a number
of others whose names I do not remember.</p>

<p>What an interesting character is Squire Bancroft.
I am told that he is England's oldest living
actor, and he is now retired. He does not look as
though he should retire.</p>

<p>I am late and that adds to an embarrassment
which started as soon as I knew I was to meet
Barrie and so many other famous people.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span></p>

<p>There is Barrie. He is pointed out to me just
about the time I recognise him myself. This is my
primary reason for coming. To meet Barrie. He
is a small man, with a dark moustache and a deeply
marked, sad face, with heavily shadowed eyes; but
I detect lines of humour lurking around his mouth.
Cynical? Not exactly.</p>

<p>I catch his eye and make motions for us to sit
together, and then find that the party had been
planned that way anyhow. There is the inevitable
hush for introductions. How I hate it. Names
are the bane of my existence. Personalities, that's
the thing.</p>

<p>But everyone seems jovial except Barrie. His
eyes look sad and tired. But he brightens as
though all along there had been that hidden smile
behind the mask. I wonder if they are all friendly
toward me, or if I am just the curiosity of the
moment.</p>

<p>There is an embarrassing pause, after we have
filed into the dining-room, which E. V. Lucas
breaks.</p>

<p>"Gentlemen, be seated."</p>

<p>I felt almost like a minstrel man and the guests
took their seats as simultaneously as though
rehearsed for it.</p>

<p>I feel very uncomfortable mentally. I cough.
What shall I say to Barrie? Why hadn't I given
it some thought? I am aware that Squire Bancroft
is seated at my other side. I feel as though I am
in a vice with its jaws closing as the clock ticks.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
Why did I come? The atmosphere is so heavy,
yet I am sure they feel most hospitable toward me.</p>

<p>I steal a glance at Squire Bancroft. He looks
every bit the eminent old-school actor. The dignity
and tradition of the English stage is written into
every line in his face. I remember Nicholson
having said that the squire would not go to a
"movie," that he regarded his stand as a principle.
Then why is he here? He is going to be difficult, I
fear.</p>

<p>He breaks the ice with the announcement that he
had been to a movie that day! Coming from him
it was almost a shock.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chaplin, the reading of the letter in
'Shoulder Arms' was the high spot of the picture."
This serious consideration from the man
who would not go to the movies.</p>

<p>I wanted to hug him. Then I learn that he had
told everyone not to say anything about his not
having been to a movie for fear that it would offend
me. He leans over and whispers his age and tells
me he is the oldest member of the club. He doesn't
look within ten years of his age. I find myself
muttering inanities in answering him.</p>

<p>Then Barrie tells me that he is looking for some
one to play Peter Pan and says he wants me to play
it. He bowls me over completely. To think that
I was avoiding and afraid to meet such a man! But
I am afraid to discuss it with him seriously, am on
my guard because he may decide that I know
nothing about it and change his mind.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span></p>

<p>Just imagine, Barrie has asked me to play Peter
Pan! It is too big and grand to risk spoiling it by
some chance witless observation, so I change the
subject and let this golden opportunity pass. I
have failed completely in my first skirmish with
Barrie.</p>

<p>There are laboured jokes going the rounds of the
table and everyone seems to feel conscious of some
duty that is resting on his shoulders ungracefully.</p>

<p>One ruddy gentleman whose occupation is a most
serious one, I am told, that of building a giant
memorial in Whitehall to the dead of the late War,
is reacting to the situation most flippantly. His
conversation, which has risen to a pitch of almost
hysterical volume, is most ridiculously comic. He
is a delightful buffoon.</p>

<p>Everyone is laughing at his chatter, but nothing
seems to be penetrating my stupidity, though I am
carrying with me a wide mechanical grin, which I
broaden and narrow with the nuances of the table
laughing. I feel utterly out of the picture, that I
don't belong, that there must be something significant
in the badinage that is bandied about the board.</p>

<p>Barrie is speaking again about moving pictures.
I must understand. I summon all of my scattered
faculties to bear upon what he is saying. What a
peculiarly shaped head he has.</p>

<p>He is speaking of "The Kid," and I feel that
he is trying to flatter me. But how he does it! He
is criticising the picture.</p>

<p>He is very severe. He declares that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
"heaven" scene was entirely unnecessary, and
why did I give it so much attention? And why so
much of the mother in the picture, and why the
meeting of the mother and the father? All of these
things he is discussing analytically and profoundly,
so much so that I find that my feeling of self-consciousness
is rapidly leaving me.</p>

<p>I find myself giving my side of the argument
without hesitation, because I am not so sure that
Barrie is right, and I had reasons, good reasons,
for wanting all those things in the picture. But I
am thrilled at his interest and appreciation and it is
borne in upon me that by discussing dramatic construction
with me he is paying a very gracious and
subtle compliment. It is sweet of him. It relieves
me of the last vestige of my embarrassment.</p>

<p>"But, Sir James," I am saying, "I cannot
agree with you&mdash;" Imagine the metamorphosis.
And our discussion continues easily and pleasantly.
I am aware of his age as he talks and I get more of
his spirit of whimsicality.</p>

<p>The food is being served and I find that E. V.
Lucas has provided a treacle pudding, a particular
weakness of mine, to which I do justice. I am
wondering if Barrie resents age, he who is so youthful
in spirit.</p>

<p>There seems to be lots of fun in the general buffoonery
that is going on around the table, but despite
all efforts to the contrary I am serving a diet of
silence. I feel very colourless, that the whole conversation
that is being shouted is colourless.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<p>I am a good audience. I laugh at anything and
dare not speak. Why can't I be witty? Are they
trying to draw me out? Maybe I am wrong and
there is a purpose behind this buffoonery. But I
hardly know whether to retaliate in kind, or just
grin.</p>

<p>I am dying for something to happen. Lucas is
rising. We all feel the tension. Why are parties
like that? It ends.</p>

<p>Barrie is whispering, "Let's go to my apartment
for a drink and a quiet talk," and I begin to
feel that things are most worth while. Knoblock
and I walk with him to Adelphi Terrace, where his
apartment overlooks the Thames Embankment.</p>

<p>Somehow this apartment seems just like him, but
I cannot convey the resemblance in a description of
it. The first thing you see is a writing desk in a
huge room beautifully furnished, and with dark-wood
panelling. Simplicity and comfort are written
everywhere. There is a large Dutch fireplace in
the right side of the room, but the outstanding
piece of furniture is a tiny kitchen stove in one
corner. It is polished to such a point that it takes
the aspect of the ornamental rather than the useful.
He explains that on this he makes his tea
when servants are away. Such a touch, perhaps,
just the touch to suggest Barrie.</p>

<p>Our talk drifts to the movies and Barrie tells me
of the plans for filming "Peter Pan." We are
on very friendly ground in this discussion and I find
myself giving Barrie ideas for plays while he is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
giving me ideas for movies, many of them suggestions
that I can use in comedies.</p>

<p>There is a knock at the door. Gerald du Maurier
is calling. He is one of England's greatest actors
and the son of the man who wrote "Trilby." Our
party lasts far into the night, until about three in the
morning. I notice that Barrie looks rather tired
and worn, so we leave, walking with Du Maurier
up the Strand. He tells us that Barrie is not himself
since his nephew was drowned, that he has aged
considerably.</p>

<p>We walk slowly back to the hotel and to bed.</p>

<p>Next day there is a card from Bruce Bairnsfather,
England's famous cartoonist, whose work
during the war brought him international success,
inviting me to tea. He carries me out into the
country, where I have a lovely time. His wife tells
me that he is just a bundle of nerves and that he
never knows when to stop working. I ask what
H. G. Wells is like and Bruce tells me that he is
like "Wells" and no one else.</p>

<p>When I get back to the hotel there is a letter
from Wells.</p>

<p>"Do come over. I've just discovered that you
are in town. Do you want to meet Shaw? He is
really very charming out of the limelight. I suppose
you are overwhelmed with invitations, but if
there is a chance to get hold of you for a talk, I will
be charmed. How about a week-end with me at
Easton, free from publicity and with harmless,
human people. No 'phones in the house."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<p>I lost no time in accepting such an invitation.</p>

<p>There is a big luncheon party on among my
friends and I am told that a party has been arranged
to go through the Limehouse district with Thomas
Burke, who wrote "Limehouse Nights." I resent
it exceedingly and refuse to go with a crowd
to meet Burke. I revolt against the constant
crowding. I hate crowds.</p>

<p>London and its experiences are telling on me and
I am nervous and unstrung. I must see Burke and
go with him alone. He is the one man who sees
London through the same kind of glasses as
myself.</p>

<p>I am told that Burke will be disappointing because
he is so silent, but I do not believe that I will be
disappointed in him.</p>

<p>Robinson tells the crowd of my feelings and how much
I have planned on this night alone with
Burke, and the party is called off. We 'phone
Burke and I make an engagement to meet him at
his home that evening at ten o'clock. We are to
spend the night together in Limehouse. What a
prospect!</p>

<p>That night I was at Thomas Burke's ahead of
time. The prospect of a night spent in the Limehouse
district with the author of "Limehouse
Nights" was as alluring as Christmas morning to
a child.</p>

<p>Burke is so different from what I expected.
"Limehouse Nights" had led me to look for some
one physically, as well as mentally, big, though I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
had always pictured him as mild-mannered and
tremendously human and sympathetic.</p>

<p>I notice even as we are introduced that Burke
looks tired and it is hard to think that this little man
with the thin, peaked face and sensitive features is
the same one who has blazed into literature such
elemental lusts, passions and emotions as characterise
his short stories.</p>

<p>I am told that he doesn't give out much. I
wonder just who he is like. He is very curious.
Doesn't seem to be noticing anything that goes on
about him. He just sits with his arm to his face,
leaning on his hand and gazing into the fire. As
he sits there, apparently unperturbed and indifferent,
I am warming up to him considerably. I
feel a sort of master of the situation. It's a comfortable
feeling. Is the reticence real or is this
some wonderful trick of his, this making his guest
feel superior?</p>

<p>His tired-looking, sensitive eyes at first seem
rather severe and serious, but suddenly I am aware
of something keen, quick and twinkling in them.
His wife has arrived. A very young lady of great
charm, who makes you feel instantly her artistic
capabilities even in ordinary conversation.</p>

<p>Shortly after his wife comes in Burke and I leave,
I feeling very much the tourist in the hands of the
super city guide.</p>

<p>"What, where&mdash;anything particular that I want
to see?"</p>

<p>This rather scares me, but I take it as a challenge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
and make up my mind that I will know him. He
is difficult, and, somehow, I don't believe that he
cares for movie actors. Maybe I am only possible
"copy" to him?</p>

<p>He seems to be doing me a kindness and I find
myself feeling rather stiff and on my best behaviour,
but I resolve that before the evening is through I
will make him open up and like me, for I am sure
that his interest is well worth while.</p>

<p>I have nothing to suggest except that we ramble
along with nothing deliberate in view. I feel that
this pleases him, for a light of interest comes into
his eyes, chasing one of responsibility. We are
just going to stroll along.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span></p>

<h2>X.<br />
<br />
I MEET THOMAS BURKE AND
H. G. WELLS</h2>

<p class="p2">As Burke and I ramble along toward no place
in particular, I talk about his book. I have
read "Limehouse Nights" as he wrote it.
There is nothing I could see half so effective. We
discuss the fact that realities such as he has kept
alive seldom happen in a stroll, but I am satisfied.
I don't want to see. It could not be more beautiful
than the book. There is no reaction to my flattery.
I must watch good taste. I feel that he is very
intelligent, and I am silent for quite a while
as we stroll toward Stepney. There is a
greenish mist hanging about everything and we
seem to be in a labyrinth of narrow alleyways, now
turning into streets and then merging into squares.
He is silent and we merely walk.</p>

<p>And then I awaken. I see his purpose. I can
do my own story&mdash;he is merely lending me the
tools, and what tools they are! I feel that I have
served an ample apprenticeship in their use,
through merely reading his stories. I am fortified.</p>

<p>It is so easy now. He has given me the stories
before. Now he is telling them over in pictures.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
The very shadows take on life and romance. The
skulking, strutting, mincing, hurrying forms that
pass us and fade out into the night are now becoming
characters. The curtain has risen on "Limehouse
Nights," dramatised with the original cast.</p>

<p>There is a tang of the east in the air and I am
tinglingly aware of something vital, living, moving,
in this murky atmosphere that is more intense
even for the occasional dim light that peers out
into the soft gloom from attic windows and storerooms,
or municipal lights that gleam on the street
corners.</p>

<p>Here is a little slice of God's fashioning, where
love runs hand in hand with death, where poetry
sings in withered Mongolian hearts, even as knives
are buried in snow-white breasts and swarthy
necks. Here hearts are broken casually, but at the
same time there comes just as often to this lotus
land the pity, terror, and wonder of first love, and
who shall say which is predominant?</p>

<p>Behind each of those tiny garret windows lurks
life&mdash;life in its most elemental costume. There is
no time, thought, or preparation for anything but
the elemental passions, and songs of joy, hope,
and laughter are written into each existence, even
as the killings go on, surely, swiftly.</p>

<p>There must be a magic wand forever doing a
pendulum swing over this land, for the point of
view often changes from the beastly to the beautiful,
and in one short moment the innocent frequently
gather the sophistication of the aged.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
These creatures of life's game run blithely along
their course ignorant of the past, joyful in the present,
and careless of the future, while their tiny
lightened windows seem to wink deliberately as
they make pinpricks of light through the shuttered
gloom.</p>

<p>On the other side of the street there is stepping
a little lady whose cheap cotton clothes are cut with
Parisian cunning, and as we cross and pass her we
discern beauty, enhanced manyfold by youth and
vitality, but hardened with premature knowledge.
I can't help but think of little Gracie Goodnight,
the little lady who resented the touch of a "Chink,"
so much so that she filled the fire extinguishers in
his place with oil, and when he was trapped in the
blazing building, calmly, and with a baby smile
upon her face, poured the contents of the extinguisher
over him and his furniture.</p>

<p>There is the Queen's Theatre, bringing forward
a mental picture of little Gina of Chinatown, who
stopped a panic in the fire-frightened audience of
the playhouse as her début offering on the stage.
Little Gina, who brought the whole neighbourhood
to her feet in her joyous dancing delight. Little
Gina, who at fourteen had lived, laughed, and
loved, and who met death with a smile, carrying
the secret of him with her.</p>

<p>Every once in a while Burke merely lifts his
stick and points. His gesture needs no comment.
He has located and made clear without language
the only one object he could possibly mean, and,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
strangely, it is always something particularly interesting
to me. He is most unusual.</p>

<p>What a guide he is! He is not showing me
Main Street, not the obvious, not even the sightseer's
landmarks, but in this rambling I am getting
the heart, the soul, the feeling. I feel that he has
gauged me quickly&mdash;that he knows I love feelings
rather than details, that he is unconsciously flattering
to my subtlety, after two miles through black,
though lovely, shadows.</p>

<p>Now he is picking the spots where lights are
shining from the fish shops. He knows their locations,
knows their lights because he has studied
them well. There are forms slinking gracefully,
as though on location and with rehearsed movement.
What an effect for a camera!</p>

<p>This is rugged. Here are the robust of the
slums. People act more quickly here than in Lambeth.
And suddenly we are back where we started.
In a car we go to the old Britannia, Hoxton, rather
reluctantly.</p>

<p>There is a glaring moving-picture palace. What
a pity! I resent its obtrusion. We go along toward
the East India Docks&mdash;to Shadwell. And
I am feeling creepy with the horror of his stories
of Shadwell. I could hear a child screaming behind
a shuttered window and I wondered and imagined,
but we did not stop anywhere.</p>

<p>We meandered along with just an occasional
gesture from him, all that was necessary to make
his point. To Stanhope Road, Bethnal Green,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
Spitalfields, Ratcliffe, Soho, Notting Dale, and
Camden Town.</p>

<p>And through it all I have the feeling that things
trivial, portentous, beautiful, sordid, cringing,
glorious, simple, epochal, hateful, lovable are
happening behind closed doors. I people all those
shacks with girls, boys, murders, shrieks, life,
beauty.</p>

<p>As we go back we talk of life in the world
outside this adventurous Utopia. He tells
me that he has never been outside of London, not
even to Paris. This is very curious to me, but
it doesn't seem so as he says it. He tells me of
another book that he has ready and of a play that
he is working on for early production. We
talked until three in the morning and I went back to
my hotel with the same sort of feelings that I had
at twelve when I sat up all night reading Stevenson's
"Treasure Island."</p>

<p>The next day I did some shopping, and was
measured for boots. How different is shopping
here! A graceful ceremony that is pleasing even
to a man. The sole advertisement I see in the
shop is "Patronised by His Majesty." It is all
said in that one phrase.</p>

<p>And the same methods have been in vogue at
this bootmaker's for centuries. My foot is placed
on a piece of paper and the outline drawn. Then
measurements are taken of the instep, ankle, and
calf, as I want riding boots. Old-fashioned they
will probably continue until the end of time, yet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
somehow I sort of felt that if that old shop had a
tongue to put in its cheek, there it would be parked,
because tradition, as an aid to the cash register, is
no novelty.</p>

<p>In the evening I dined at the Embassy Club with
Sonny, and was made an honorary member of the
club.</p>

<p>It is amazing how much Europe is aping
America, particularly with its dance music. In cafés
you hear all the popular airs that are being played
on Broadway. The American influence has been
felt to such an extent that King Jazz is a universal
potentate. Sonny and I go to the theatre and see
a part of the "League of Notions," but we leave
early and I run to say hello to Constance Collier,
who is playing in London.</p>

<p>The next day is exciting. Through the invitation
of a third party I am to meet H. G. Wells
at Stoll's office to view the first showing of Wells's
picture, "Kipps."</p>

<p>In the morning the telephone rings and I hear
some one in the parlour say that the Prince of
Wales is calling. I get in a blue funk, as does
everyone else in the apartment, and I hear them
rush toward the 'phone. But Ed. Knoblock
claiming to be versed in the proper method of
handling such a situation, convinces everyone that
he is the one to do the talking and I relapse back
into bed, but wider awake than I ever was in my
life.</p>

<p>Knoblock on the 'phone:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you there? ... Yes ... Oh, yes
 ... to-night ... Thank you."</p>

<p>Knoblock turning from the 'phone announces,
very formally, "The Prince of Wales wishes
Charlie to dine with him to-night," and he starts
toward my bedroom door. (Through all of this I
have been in the bedroom, and the others are in
the parlour confident, with the confidence of
custom, that I am still asleep.)</p>

<p>As Knoblock starts for my bedroom door my
very American secretary, in the very routine voice
he has trained for such occurrences, says:</p>

<p>"Don't wake him. Tell him to call later. Not
before two o'clock."</p>

<p>Knoblock: "Good God man! This is the
Prince of Wales," and he launches into a monologue
regarding the traditions of England and the
customs of Court and what a momentous occasion
this is, contemptuously observing that I am in
bed and my secretary wants him to tell the Prince
to call later! He cannot get the American viewpoint.</p>

<p>Knoblock's sincere indignation wins, and the
secretary backs away from the bedroom as I plunge
under the covers and feign sleep. Knoblock
comes in very dignified and, trying to keep his
voice in the most casual tone, announces, "Keep
to-night open to dine with the Prince of Wales."</p>

<p>I try to enter into it properly, but I feel rather
stiff so early in the morning. I try to remonstrate
with him for having made the engagement. I have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
another engagement with H. G. Wells, but I am
thrilled at the thought of dining with the Prince in
Buckingham Palace. I can't do it. What must
I do?</p>

<p>Knoblock takes me in hand. He repeats the
message. I think some one is spoofing and tell
him so. I am very suspicious, and the thrill leaves
me as I remember that the Prince is in Scotland,
shooting. How could he get back?</p>

<p>But Knoblock is practical. This must go
through. And I think he is a bit sore at me for my
lack of appreciation. He would go to the palace
himself and find out everything. He goes to the
palace to verify.</p>

<p>I can't tell his part of it&mdash;he was very vague&mdash;but
I gathered that when he reached there he found
all the furniture under covers, and I can hear that
butler now saying:</p>

<p>"His Royal Highness the Prince will not be
back for several days, sir."</p>

<p>Poor Ed.! It was quite a blow for him, and, on
the level, I was a bit disappointed myself.</p>

<p>But I lost no time mooning over my lost chance
to dine with royalty, for that afternoon I was going
to meet Wells. Going to Stoll's; I was eagerly
looking forward to a quiet little party where I could
get off somewhere with Wells and have a long
talk.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_148" id="i_148"></a>
<img src="images/i_148.jpg" width="550" height="389" alt="" />
<p class="caption">I meet H. G. Wells.</p>
</div>

<p>As I drew near the office, however, I noticed
crowds, the same sort of crowds that I had been
dodging since my exit from Los Angeles. It was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
a dense mass of humanity packed around the entire
front of the building, waiting for something that had
been promised them. And then I knew that it
was an arranged affair and that, so far as a chat
was concerned, Wells and I were just among
those present, even though we were the guests of
honour.</p>

<p>I remember keenly the crush in the elevator, a
tiny little affair built for about six people and carrying
nearer sixty. I get the viewpoint of a sardine
quite easily. Upstairs it is not so bad, and I am
swept into a room where there are only a few people
and the door is then closed. I look all around, trying
to spot Wells. There he is.</p>

<p>I notice his beautiful, dark-blue eyes first.
Keen and kindly they are, twinkling just now as
though he were inwardly smiling, perhaps at my
very apparent embarrassment.</p>

<p>Before we can get together, however, there
comes forward the camera brigade with its flashlight
ammunition. Would we pose together?
Wells looks hopeless. I must show that before
cameras I am very much of a person, and I take
the initiative with the lens peepers.</p>

<p>We are photoed sitting, standing, hats on and
off, and in every other stereotyped position known
to camera men.</p>

<p>We sign a number of photos, I in my large, sweeping,
sprawling hand&mdash;I remember handling the
pen in a dashing, swashbuckling manner&mdash;then
Wells, in his small, hardly discernible style. I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
very conscious of this difference, and I feel as
though I had started to sing aloud before a group
of grand-opera stars.</p>

<p>Then there is a quick-sketch artist for whom we
pose. He does his work rapidly, however, and
while he is drawing Wells leans over and whispers
in my ear.</p>

<p>"We are the goats," he tells me. "I was
invited here to meet you and you were probably
invited here to meet me."</p>

<p>He had called the turn perfectly, and when
we had both accepted the invitation our double acceptance
had been used to make the showing
an important event. I don't think that Wells
liked it.</p>

<p>Wells and I go into the dark projection room and
I sit with Wells. I feel on my mettle almost immediately,
sitting at his side, and I feel rather glad that
we are spending our first moments in an atmosphere
where I am at home. In his presence I feel
critical and analytical and I decide to tell the truth
about the picture at all costs. I feel that Wells
would do the same thing about one of mine.</p>

<p>As the picture is reeling off I whisper to him my
likes and dislikes, principally the faulty photography,
though occasionally I detect bad direction.
Wells remains perfectly silent and I begin to feel
that I am not breaking the ice. It is impossible to
get acquainted under these conditions. Thank
God, I can keep silent, because there is the picture
to watch and that saves the day.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span></p>

<p>Then Wells whispers, "Don't you think the
boy is good?"</p>

<p>The boy in question is right here on the other
side of me, watching his first picture. I look at
him. Just starting out on a new career, vibrant
with ambition, eager to make good, and his first
attempt being shown before such an audience. As
I watch he is almost in tears, nervous and anxious.</p>

<p>The picture ends. There is a mob clustering
about. Directors and officials look at me. They
want my opinion of the picture. I shall be truthful.
Shall I criticise? Wells nudges me and whispers,
"Say something nice about the boy." And I look at
the boy and see what Wells has already seen and
then I say the nice things about him. Wells's kindness
and consideration mean so much more than a
mere picture.</p>

<p>Wells is leaving and we are to meet for dinner,
and I am left alone to work my way through the
crush to the taxi and back to the hotel, where I
snatch a bit of a nap. I want to be in form for
Wells.</p>

<p>There comes a little message from him:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
Don't forget the dinner. You can wrap up in a cloak
if you deem it advisable, and slip in about 7.30 and we
can dine in peace.</p>

Whitehall Court, Entrance 4.
</p>
</div>

<p>We talk of Russia and I find no embarrassment
in airing my views, but I soon find myself merely
the questioner. Wells talks; and, though he sees
with the vision of a dreamer, he brings to his views
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
the practical. As he talks he appears very much
like an American. He seems very young and full
of "pep."</p>

<p>There is the general feeling that conditions will
right themselves in some way. Organisation is
needed, he says, and is just as important as disarmament.
Education is the only salvation, not only of
Russia, but of the rest of the world. Socialism of
the right sort will come through proper education.
We discuss my prospects of getting into Russia. I
want to see it. Wells tells me that I am at the
wrong time of the year, that the cold weather coming
on would make the trip most inadvisable.</p>

<p>I talk about going to Spain, and he seems surprised
to hear that I want to see a bull fight. He
asks, "Why?"</p>

<p>I don't know, except that there is something so
nakedly elemental about it. There is a picturesque
technique about it that must appeal to any artist.
Perhaps Frank Harris's "Matador" gave me the
impulse, together with my perpetual quest for a
new experience. He says it is too cruel to the
horses.</p>

<p>I relax as the evening goes on and I find that I
am liking him even more than I expected. About
midnight we go out on a balcony just off his library,
and in the light of a full moon we get a gorgeous
view of London. Lying before us in the soft,
mellow rays of the moon, London looks as though
human, and I feel that we are rather in the Peeping
Tom <i>rôle</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span></p>

<p>I exclaim, "The indecent moon."</p>

<p>He picks me up. "That's good. Where did
you get that?"</p>

<p>I have to admit that it is not original&mdash;that it
belongs to Knoblock.</p>

<p>Wells comments on my dapperness as he helps
me on with my coat. "I see you have a cane with
you." I was also wearing a silk hat. I wonder
what Los Angeles and Hollywood would say if I
paraded there in this costume?</p>

<p>Wells tries on my hat, then takes my cane and
twirls it. The effect is ridiculous, especially as just
at the moment I notice the two volumes of the
"Outline of History" on his table.</p>

<p>Strutting stagily, he chants, "You're quite the
fellow doncher know."</p>

<p>We both laugh. Another virtue for Wells.
He's human.</p>

<p>I try to explain my dress. Tell him that it is my
other self, a reaction from the everyday Chaplin.
I have always desired to look natty and I have
spurts of primness. Everything about me and
my work is so sensational that I must get reaction.
My dress is a part of it. I feel that it is a poor
explanation of the paradox, but Wells thinks otherwise.</p>

<p>He says I notice things. That I am an observer
and an analyst. I am pleased. I tell him that the
only way I notice things is on the run. Whatever
keenness of perception I have is momentary, fleeting.
I observe all in ten minutes or not at all.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span></p>

<p>What a pleasant evening it is! But as I walk
along toward the hotel I feel that I have not met
Wells yet.</p>

<p>And I am going to have another opportunity. I
am going to have a week-end with him at his home
in Easton, a week-end with Wells at home, with
just his family. That alone is worth the entire trip
from Los Angeles to Europe.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span></p>

<h2>XI.<br />
<br />
OFF TO FRANCE</h2>

<p class="p2">The hotel next day is teeming with activity.</p>

<p>My secretaries are immersed in mail and,
despite the assistance of six girls whom they
have added temporarily to our forces, the mail bags
are piling up and keeping ahead of us.</p>

<p>In a fit of generosity or ennui or something I pitch
in and help. It seems to be the most interesting
thing I have attempted on the trip. Why didn't I
think of it sooner? Here is drama. Here is life
in abundance. Each letter I read brings forth new
settings, new characters, new problems. I find
myself picking out many letters asking for charity.
I lay these aside.</p>

<p>I have made up my mind to go to France immediately.</p>

<p>I call Carl Robinson. I tell him that we are
going to France, to Paris, at once. Carl is not surprised.
He has been with me for a long time. We
decide that we tell nobody and perhaps we can
escape ceremonies. We will keep the apartment at
the Ritz and keep the stenographers working, so
that callers will think that we are hiding about
London somewhere.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span></p>

<p>We are going to leave on Sunday and our plans
are perfected in rapid-fire order. We plunge about
in a terrible rush as we try to arrange everything at
the last minute without giving the appearance of
arranging anything.</p>

<p>And in spite of everything, there is a mob at the
station to see us off and autograph books are thrown
at me from all sides. I sign for as many as I can
and upon the others I bestow my "prop" grin.
Wonder if I look like Doug when I do this?</p>

<p>We meet the skipper. What does one ask
skippers? Oh yes, how does it look to-day
for crossing? As I ask, I cast my weather eye out
into the Channel and it looks decidedly rough for
me.</p>

<p>But the skipper's "just a bit choppy" disarms
me.</p>

<p>I am eager to get on the boat, and the first person
I meet is Baron Long, owner of a hotel in San
Diego. Good heavens! Can't I ever get away
from Hollywood? I am glad to see him, but not
now. He is very clever, however. He senses the
situation, smiles quick "hellos," and then makes
himself scarce. In fact, I think he wanted to get
away himself. Maybe he was as anxious for a holiday
as I.</p>

<p>I am approached on the boat by two very charming
girls. They want my autograph. Ah, this is
nice! I never enjoyed writing my name more.</p>

<p>How I wish that I had learned French. I feel
hopelessly sunk, because after about three sentences
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
in French I am a total loss so far as conversation is
concerned. One girl promises to give me a French
lesson. This promises to be a pleasant trip.</p>

<p>I am told that in France they call me Charlot.
We are by this time strolling about the boat and
bowing every other minute. It is getting rough and
I find myself saying I rather like it that way. Liar.</p>

<p>She is speaking. I smile. She smiles. She is
talking in French. I am getting about every eighth
word. I cannot seem to concentrate, French is
so difficult. Maybe it's the boat.</p>

<p>I am dying rapidly. I feel like a dead weight
on her arm. I can almost feel myself get pale as
I try to say something, anything. I am weak and
perspiring. I blurt out, "I beg pardon," and
then I rush off to my cabin and lie down. Oh,
why did I leave England? Something smells
horrible. I look up. My head is near a new pigskin
bag. Yes, that's it, that awful leathery smell.
But I have company. Robinson is in the cabin
with me and we are matching ailments.</p>

<p>Thus we spent the trip from Dover to Calais and
I was as glad to get to the French coast as the
Kaiser would have been had he kept that dinner
engagement in Paris.</p>

<p>Nearing France, I am almost forgetting my sickness.
There is something in the atmosphere.
Something vibrant. The tempo of life is faster.
The springs in its mechanism are wound taut. I
feel as if I would like to take it apart and look at
those springs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span></p>

<p>I am met by the chief of police, which surprised
me, because I was confident that I had been canny
enough to make a getaway this time. But no.
The boat enters the quay and I see the dock
crowded with people. Some treachery. Hats
are waving, kisses are being thrown, and there are
cheers. Cheers that I can only get through the
expression, because they are in French and I am
notoriously deficient in that language.</p>

<p>"<i>Vive le Charlot!</i>" "Bravo, Charlot!"</p>

<p>I am "Charloted" all over the place. Strange,
this foreign tongue. Wonder why a universal
language isn't practicable? They are crowding
about me, asking for autographs. Or at least I
think they are, because they are pushing books
in my face, though for the life of me I can't make
out a word of their chatter. But I smile. God
bless that old "prop" grin, because they seem to
like it.</p>

<p>Twice I was kissed. I was afraid to look around
to see who did it, because I knew I was in France.
And you've got to give me the benefit of the doubt.
I am hoping that both kisses came from pretty
girls, though I do think that at least one of those
girls should shave.</p>

<p>They examine my signature closely. They
seem puzzled. I look. It is spelled right. Oh,
I see! They expected "Charlot." And I write
some more with "Charlot."</p>

<p>I am being bundled along to a funny little French
train. It seems like a toy. But I am enjoying the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
difference. Everything is all changed. The new
money, the new language, the new faces, the new
architecture&mdash;it's a grown-up three-ring circus to
me. The crowd gives a concerted cheer as the
train pulls out and a few intrepid ones run alongside
until distanced by steam and steel.</p>

<p>We go into the dining-room and here is a fresh
surprise. The dinner is <i>table d'hôte</i> and three
waiters are serving it. Everyone is served at once,
and as one man is taking up the soup plates another
is serving the next course. Here is French
economy&mdash;economy that seems very sensible as
they have perfected it. It seems so different from
America, where waiters always seem to be falling
over one another in dining-rooms. And wines
with the meal! And the check; it did not resemble
in size the national debt, as dinner checks usually
do in America.</p>

<p>It has started to rain as we arrive in Paris, which
adds to my state of excitement, and a reportorial
avalanche falls upon me. I am about overcome.
How did reporters know I was coming? The
crowd outside the station is almost as large as the
one in London.</p>

<p>I am still feeling the effects of my sea-sickness. I
am not equal to speaking nor answering questions.
We go to the Customs house and one journalist,
finding us, suggests and points another way
out. I am sick. I must disappoint the crowd,
and I leap into a taxi and am driven to Claridge's
Hotel.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span></p>

<p>"Out of the frying pan." Here are more
reporters. And they speak nothing but French.
The hubbub is awful. We talk to one another.
We shout at one another. We talk slowly. We
spell. We do everything to make Frenchmen
understand English, and Englishmen understand
French, but it is no use. One of them manages to
ask me what I think of Paris.</p>

<p>I answer that I never saw so many Frenchmen
in my life. I am looking forward eagerly to meeting
Cami, the famous French cartoonist. We
have been corresponding for several years, he sending
me many drawings and I sending him still
photos from pictures. We had built up quite a
friendship and I have been looking forward to a
meeting. I see him.</p>

<p>He is coming to me and we are both smiling
broadly as we open our arms to each other.</p>

<p>"Cami!"</p>

<p>"Charlot!"</p>

<p>Our greeting is most effusive. And then something
goes wrong. He is talking in French, a
blue streak, with the rapidity of a machine-gun.
I can feel my smile fading into blankness. Then
I get an inspiration. I start talking in English just
as rapidly. Then we both talk at once. It's the
old story of the irresistible force and the immovable
body. We get nowhere.</p>

<p>Then I try talking slowly, extremely slow.</p>

<p>"Do&mdash;you&mdash;understand?"</p>

<p>It means nothing. We both realise at the same
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
time what a hopeless thing our interview is. We
are sad a bit, then we smile at the absurdity
of it.</p>

<p>He is still Cami and I am still Charlot, so we grin
and have a good time, anyhow.</p>

<p>He stays to dinner, which is a hectic meal, for
through it all I am tasting this Paris, this Paris that
is waiting for me. We go out and to the Folies Bergère.
Paris does not seem as light as I expected it
to be.</p>

<p>And the Folies Bergère seems shabbier. I
remember having played here once myself with a
pantomime act. How grand it looked then.
Rather antiquated now. Somehow it saddened
me, this bit of memory that was chased up before
me.</p>

<p>Next day there is a luncheon with Dudley Field
Malone and Waldo Frank. It is a brisk and
vivacious meal except when it is broken up by a visit
from the American newspaper correspondents.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chaplin, why did you come to Europe?"</p>

<p>"Are you going to Russia?"</p>

<p>"Did you call on Shaw?"</p>

<p>They must have cabled over a set of questions.
I went all over the catechism for them and managed
to keep the "prop" grin at work. I wouldn't let
them spoil Paris for me.</p>

<p>We escape after a bit, and back at the hotel I
notice an air of formality creeping into the atmosphere
as I hear voices in the parlour of my suite.
Then my secretary comes in and announces that a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
very important personage is calling and would
speak with me.</p>

<p>He enters, an attractive-looking gentleman, and
he speaks English.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chaplin, that I am to you talk of greetings
from the heart of the people with France, that
you make laugh. Cannot you forego to make showing
of yourself with charity sometime for devastated
France? On its behalf, I say to you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I tell him that I will take it up later.</p>

<p>He smiles, "Ah, you are boozy."</p>

<p>"Oh, no. I haven't had a drink for several
days," I hasten to inform him. "I am busy and
want to get to bed early to-night."</p>

<p>But Malone butts in with, "Oh yes, he's very
boozy."</p>

<p>And I get a bit indignant until Malone tells me
that the Frenchman means "busy."</p>

<p>Then I am told that there is one young journalist
still waiting who has been here all day, refusing to
go until I have seen him.</p>

<p>I tell them to bring him in. He comes in smiling
in triumph.</p>

<p>And he can't speak English.</p>

<p>After his hours of waiting we cannot talk.</p>

<p>I feel rather sorry for him and we do our best.
Finally, with the aid of about everyone in the hotel
he manages to ask:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you like France?"</p>

<p>"Yes," I answer.</p>

<p>He is satisfied.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>

<p class="caption">In Paris with Sir Philip Sassoon and Georges Carpentier.</p>
</div>

<p>Waldo Frank and I sit on a bench in the Champs
Elysées and watch the wagons going to market
in the early morning. Paris seems most beautiful
to me just at this time.</p>

<p>What a city! What is the force that has made
it what it is? Could anyone conceive such a
creation, such a land of continuous gaiety? It is a
masterpiece among cities, the last word in pleasure.
Yet I feel that something has happened to it, something
that they are trying to cover by heightened
plunges into song and laughter.</p>

<p>We stroll along the boulevard and it is growing
light. I am recognised and we are being followed.
We are passing a church. There is an old woman
asleep on the steps, but she does not seem worn
and haggard. There is almost a smile on her face
as she sleeps. She typifies Paris to me. Hides her
poverty behind a smile.</p>

<p>Sir Philip Sassoon, who is the confidential secretary
to Lloyd George, calls the next day with
Georges Carpentier, the pugilistic idol of France,
and we are photographed many times, the three of
us together, and separately.</p>

<p>I am quite surprised that Sir Philip is such a
young man. I had pictured the secretary of Lloyd
George as rather a dignified and aged person. He
makes an appointment for me to dine with Lord and
Lady Rocksavage the next day. Lady Rocksavage
is his sister.</p>

<p>I also lunch with them the next day, and then to
a very fashionable modiste's for some shopping.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
This is my first offence of this sort. I meet Lady
Astor, who is shopping there also.</p>

<p>It was quite a treat for me, watching the models
in this huge, elaborate institution that was really a
palace in appointments. In fact, it greatly resembled
the palace at Versailles.</p>

<p>I felt very meek when tall, suave creatures
strolled out and swept past me, some imperious,
some contemptuous. It was a studied air, but they
did it well. I wonder what effect it has on the girl's
mind as she parades herself before the high-born
ladies and gentlemen.</p>

<p>But I catch the imperfection in their schooling.
It is very amusing to watch them strut about until
their display is made, and then, their stunt done,
slouch back into the dressing-rooms <i>sans</i> carriage
and manner.</p>

<p>And then, too, I am discovered. This also
causes a break in the spell of their queenly stroll.
They are laughing and at the same time trying to
maintain the dignity due to the gowns they are
wearing. They become self-conscious and the
effect is ludicrous.</p>

<p>I am demoralising the institution, so we get away.
I would like to talk to some of the models, but it
can't be done very well.</p>

<p>From there we go to a candy store, where I lay
in a supply of chocolates and preserved fruits for
my trip into Germany the next day. I am invited
by Sir Philip to visit him at his country home in
Lympne, Kent, on my return from Germany.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span></p>

<p>That evening I go with a party of Dudley Field
Malone's to the Palais Royale in the Montmartre
district. This is a novelty. Different. Seems
several steps ahead of America. And it has atmosphere,
something entirely its own, that you feel so
much more than you do the tangible things about
you.</p>

<p>There is a woman wearing a monocle. A simple
touch, but how it changes! The fashions here proclaim
themselves even without comparison and
expert opinion.</p>

<p>The music is simple, exotic, neurotic. Its simplicity
demands attention. It reaches inside you
instead of affecting your feet.</p>

<p>They are dancing a tango. It is entertainment
just to watch them. The pauses in the music, its
dreamy cadences, its insinuation, its suggestiveness,
its whining, almost monotonous swing. It is
tropical yet, this Paris. And I realise that Paris is
at a high pitch. Paris has not yet had relief from
the cloddy numbness brought on with the War. I
wonder will relief come easily or will there be a
conflagration.</p>

<p>I meet Doughie, the correspondent. We recall
our first meeting in the kitchen of Christine's in
Greenwich Village.</p>

<p>It is soon noised about that I am here and our
table takes on the atmosphere of a reception. What
a medley!</p>

<p>Strangely garbed artists, long-haired poets,
news-sheet and flower vendors, sightseers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
students, children, and cocottes. Presently came
a friend whom it was good to see again and we fix
up a bit of a party and get into Dudley's petrol
wagon, and as we bowl along we sing songs, ancient
songs of the music-halls. "After the Ball," "The
Man That Broke the Bank of Monte Carlo,"
and many another which I had not thought of in
years.</p>

<p>Presently the wagon becomes balky and will not
continue. So we all pile out and into a tavern near
by, where we call for wine.</p>

<p>And Dudley played upon the tin-pan-sounding
piano. There came one, a tall, strange, pale youth,
who asked if we would like to go to the haunt of
the Agile Rabbit. Thence uphill and into a
cavernous place. When the patron came the youth
ordered wine for us. Somehow I think he sensed
the fact that I wanted to remain incognito.</p>

<p>The patron was such a perfect host. Ancient
and white bearded, he served us with a finesse that
was pure artistry. Then at his command one
named Réné Chedecal, with a sad, haunted face,
played upon the violin.</p>

<p>That little house sheltered music that night. He
played as if from his soul, a message&mdash;yearning,
passionate, sad, gay, and we were speechless before
the emotional beauty and mystery of it.</p>

<p>I was overcome. I wanted to express my appreciation,
but could do no more than grasp his hand.
Genius breeds in strange places and humble.</p>

<p>And then the bearded one sang a song that he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
said the followers of Lafayette had sung before they
left France for America. And all of us joined in
the chorus, singing lustily.</p>

<p>Then a young chap did two songs from Verlaine,
and a poet with considerable skill recited from his
own poems. How effective for the creator of a
thought to interpret it. And afterward the violin
player gave us another selection of great beauty,
one of his own compositions.</p>

<p>Then the old patron asked me to put my name
in his ledger, which contained many names of both
humble and famous. I drew a picture of my hat,
cane, and boots, which is my favourite autograph.
I wrote, "I would sooner be a gipsy than a movie
man," and signed my name.</p>

<p>Home in the petrol wagon, which by this time
had become manageable again. An evening of
rareness. Beauty, excitement, sadness and contact
with human, lovable personalities.</p>

<p>Waldo Frank called the next day, bringing with
him Jacques Copeau, one of the foremost dramatists
and actors in France, who manages and directs in his
own theatre. We go to the circus together and I
never saw so many sad-faced clowns. We dine
together, and late that night I have supper with
Copeau's company in a café in the Latin Quarter.
It is a gay night, lasting until about three in the
morning.</p>

<p>Frank and I set out to walk home together, but
the section is too fascinating. Along about four
o'clock we drift into another café, dimly lit but well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
attended. We sit there for some time, studying
the various occupants.</p>

<p>Over in one corner a young girl has just leaned
over and kissed her sailor companion. No one
seems to notice. All the girls here seem young,
but their actions stamp their vocations. Music,
stimulating, exotic, and for the dance, is being
played. The girls are very much alive. They are
putting their hats on the men's heads.</p>

<p>There are three peasant farmer boys, in all probability.
They seem very much embarrassed as
three tiny girls, bright-eyed and red-lipped, join
them for a drink. I can see fire smouldering in their
dull faces in spite of their awkwardness in welcoming
the girls.</p>

<p>An interesting figure, Corsican, I should say, is
very conspicuous. A gentleman by his bearing,
debonair and graceful, he looks the very picture of
an impecunious count. He is visiting all the tables
in the café. At most of them he calls the girls by
their first names.</p>

<p>He is taking up a collection for the musicians.
Everyone is contributing liberally. With each tinkle
of a coin in the hat the Corsican bows elaborately
and extends thanks.</p>

<p>He finishes the collection.</p>

<p>"On with the dance," he shouts. "Don't let
the music stop," as he rattles the money. Then he
puts his hand in his pocket and draws forth a single
centime piece. It is very small, but his manner is
that of a philanthropist.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span></p>

<p>"I give something, no matter how small; you
notice, ladies and gentlemen, that I give something,"
and he drops his coin in the hat and bows.</p>

<p>The party progresses rapidly. They have started
singing and have had just enough drink to make
them maudlin. We leave.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span></p>

<h2>XII.<br />
<br />
MY VISIT TO GERMANY</h2>

<p class="p2">The train to Germany left so late in the evening
that it was impossible for me to see devastated
France even though we passed through a
considerable portion of it. Our compartment on
the train is very stuffy and smelly and the train service
is atrocious, food and sanitary conditions being
intolerable after American train service.</p>

<p>Again there is a crowd at the station to see me off,
but I am rather enjoying it. A beautiful French
girl presents me with a bouquet of flowers with a
cute little speech, or at least I suppose it was,
because she looked very cute delivering it, and the
pouts that the language gave to her red lips were
most provocative. She tells me in delicious broken
English that I look tired and sad, and I find myself
yielding without a struggle to her suggestion.</p>

<p>We arrive at Joumont near the Belgian frontier
along about midnight, and, like a message from
home, there is a gang of American soldier boys at
the station to greet me. And they are not alone, for
French, Belgian, and British troops are also waving
and cheering. I wanted to talk to the Belgians, and
we tried it, but it was no use. What a pity!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span></p>

<p>But one of them had a happy inspiration and
saved the day.</p>

<p>"Glass of beer, Charlot?"</p>

<p>I nod, smiling. And to my surprise they bring
me beer, which I lift to my lips for politeness, and
then drink it to the last drop in pure pleasure. It
is very good beer.</p>

<p>There is a group of charming little Belgian girls.
They are smiling at me shyly and I so want to say
something to them. But I can't. Ah, the bouquet!
Each little girl gets a rose and they are delighted.</p>

<p>"<i>Merci, merci</i>, monsieur." And they keep
"merciing" and bowing until the train pulls out
of the station, which emboldens them to join the
soldiers in a cheer.</p>

<p>Through an opening between the railroad structures
I see a brilliant lighting display. It is universal,
this sign. Here is a movie in this tiny
village. What a wonderful medium, to reach such
an obscure town.</p>

<p>On the train I am being told that my pictures
have not played in Germany, hence I am practically
unknown there. This rather pleases me because I
feel that I can relax and be away from crowds.</p>

<p>Everyone on the train is nice and there is no
trouble. Conductors struggle with English for my
benefit, and the Customs officers make but little
trouble. In fact, we cross the border at three in
the morning and I am asleep.</p>

<p>Next morning I find a note from the Customs
man saying; "Good luck, Charlie. You were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
sleeping so soundly that I did not have the heart to
wake you for inspection."</p>

<p>Germany is beautiful. Germany belies the war.
There are people crowding the fields, tilling the
soil, working feverishly all the time as our train
rushes through. Men, women, and children are all
at work. They are facing their problem and
rebuilding. A great people, perverted for and by
a few.</p>

<p>The different style of architecture here is interesting.
Factories are being built everywhere. Surely
this isn't conquered territory. I do not see much
live stock in the fields. This seems strange.</p>

<p>A dining-car has been put on the train and the
waiter comes to our compartment to let us know that
we may eat. Here is a novelty. A seven-course
dinner, with wine, soup, meat, vegetables, salad,
dessert, coffee, and bread for twenty-eight
cents. This is made possible by the low rate of
exchange.</p>

<p>We go to the Adlon Hotel in Berlin and find
that hostelry jammed, owing to the auto races
which are being run off at this time. A different
atmosphere here. It seems hard for me to relax
and get the normal reaction to meeting people.
They don't know me here. I have never been
heard of. It interests me and I believe I resent it
just a bit.</p>

<p>I notice how abrupt the Germans are to
foreigners, and I detect a tinge of bitterness, too.
I am wondering about my pictures making their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
début here. I question the power of my personality
without its background of reputation.</p>

<p>I am feeling more restful under this disinterested
treatment, but somehow I wish that my pictures
had been shown here. The people at the hotel
are very courteous. They have been told that I
am the "white-headed boy and quite the guy in
my home town." Their reactions are amusing.
I am not very impressive-looking and they are
finding it hard to believe.</p>

<p>There is quite a crowd in the lobby and a
number of Americans and English. They are not
long in finding me, and a number of English,
French, and American reporters start making a
fuss over me. The Germans just stand and look
on, bewildered.</p>

<p>Carl von Weigand comes forward with the offer
of the use of his office while I am here. The
Germans are impressed with all this, but they show
no enthusiasm. I am accepted in an offhand way
as some one of importance and they let it go at that.</p>

<p>The Scala Theatre, where I spent the evening,
is most interesting, though I think a bit antiquated
when compared with English and American
theatrical progress along the same lines. It seats
about five thousand, mostly on one floor, with a
very small balcony. It is of the variety-music-hall
type, showing mostly "dumb" acts. Acts
that do not talk or sing, like comic jugglers, acrobats,
and dancers.</p>

<p>I am amused by a German comedian singing a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
song of about twenty verses, but the audience is
enthused and voices its approval at every verse.
During the intermission we have frankfurters and
beer, which are served in the theatre. I notice the
crowds. They go to the theatre there as a family.
It is just that type of an affair.</p>

<p>I notice the different types of beauty, though
beauty is not very much in evidence here. Here
and there are a few pretty girls, but not many. It
is interesting to watch the people strolling during
the intermission, drinking lager and eating all sorts
of food.</p>

<p>Leaving the theatre, we visit the Scala Café, a
sort of impressionistic casino. The Scala is one
of the largest cafés in Berlin, where the modernist
style in architecture has been carried out fully.</p>

<p>The walls are deep mottled sea green, shading
into light verdigris and emerald, leaning outward
at an angle, thereby producing an effect of collapse
and forward motion. The junction of the walls
and the ceiling is broken into irregular slabs of
stone, like the strata of a cave. Behind these the
lights are hidden, the whole system of illumination
being based on reflection.</p>

<p>The immense dislocation of the planes and angles
of the vault-like ceiling is focused on the central
point, the huge silver star or crystal bursting like
an exploding bomb through the roof. The whole
effect is weird, almost ominous. The shape of the
room in its ground plan is itself irregular&mdash;the impression
is that of a frozen catastrophe. Yet this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
feeling seems to be in accord with the mood of
revellers in Germany to-day.</p>

<p>From there to the Palais Heinroth, the most expensive
place in Berlin and the high spot of night
life. It is conspicuous in its brilliance, because
Berlin as a city is so badly lighted. At night the
streets are dark and gloomy, and it is then that one
gets the effect of war and defeat.</p>

<p>At the Heinroth everybody was in evening dress.
We weren't. My appearance did not cause any
excitement. We check our hats and coats and ask
for a table. The manager shrugs his shoulders.
There is one in the back, a most obscure part of the
room. This brings home forcibly the absence of
my reputation. It nettled me. Well, I wanted
rest. This was it.</p>

<p>We are about to accept humbly the isolated table,
when I hear a shriek and I am slapped on the back
and there's a yell:</p>

<p>"Charlie!"</p>

<p>It is Al Kaufman of the Lasky Corporation and
manager of the Famous Players studio in Berlin.</p>

<p>"Come over to our table. Pola Negri wants
to meet you."</p>

<p>Again I come into my own. The Germans look
on, wondering. I have created attention at last.
I discover that there is an American jazz band in
the place. In the middle of a number they stop
playing and shout:</p>

<p>"Hooray for Charlie Chaplin!"</p>

<p>The proprietor shrugs his shoulders and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
band resumes playing. I learn that the musicians
are former American doughboys. I feel rather
pleased that I have impressed the Germans in the
place.</p>

<p>In our party were Rita Kaufman, wife of Al,
Pola Negri, Carl Robinson, and myself.</p>

<p>Pola Negri is really beautiful. She is Polish
and really true to the type. Beautiful jet-black
hair, white, even teeth and wonderful coloring. I
think it such a pity that such coloring does not
register on the screen.</p>

<p>She is the centre of attraction here. I am introduced.
What a voice she has! Her mouth speaks
so prettily the German language. Her voice has a
soft, mellow quality, with charming inflections.
Offered a drink, she clinks my glass and offers her
only English words, "Jazz boy Charlie."</p>

<p>Language again stumps me. What a pity! But
with the aid of a third party we get along famously.
Kaufman whispers: "Charlie, you've made a hit.
She just told me that you are charming."</p>

<p>"You tell her that she's the loveliest thing I've
seen in Europe." These compliments keep up
for some time, and then I ask Kaufman how to say,
"I think you are divine" in German. He tells
me something in German and I repeat it to her.</p>

<p>She's startled and looks up and slaps my hand.</p>

<p>"Naughty boy," she says.</p>

<p>The table roars. I sense that I have been
double-crossed by Kaufman. What have I said?
But Pola joins in the joke, and there is no casualty.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
I learn later that I have said, "I think you are
terrible." I decided to go home and learn German.</p>

<p>As I am going out the proprietor approaches and
very formally addresses me: "I beg pardon, sir.
I understand that you are a great man in the United
States. Accept my apologies for not knowing, and
the gates here are always open to you." I accept
them formally, though through it all I feel very
comic opera. I didn't like the proprietor.</p>

<p>I want to go through the German slums. I mention
such a trip to a German newspaper man. I
am told that I am just like every Londoner and
New-Yorker who comes to Berlin for the first
time; that I want the Whitechapel district, the
Bowery of Berlin, and that there is no such district.
Once upon a time there were hovels in Berlin, but
they have long since disappeared.</p>

<p>This to me is a real step toward civilisation.</p>

<p>My newspaper friend tells me that he will give
me the next best thing to the slums, and we go to
Krogel. What a picture could be made here! I
am fascinated as I wander through houses mounted
on shaky stilts and courts ancient but cleanly.</p>

<p>Then we drove to Acker Street and gazed into
courts and basements. In a café we talked to men
and women and drank beer. I almost launched a
new war when, wishing to pay a charge of one
hundred and eighty marks, I pulled from my pocket
a roll of fifty one-thousand-mark notes.</p>

<p>My friend paid the check quickly with small
change and hustled me out, telling me of the hard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
faces and criminal types who were watching. He's
probably right, but I love those poor, humble
people.</p>

<p>We drove to the arbor colonies in the northern
part of the city, stopping at some of the arbors to
talk to the people. I feel that I would like to eat
dinner here among these people, but I haven't sufficient
courage to persuade my companion, who
wouldn't think of it. Passing through the northern
part of Berlin, I found many beauties which, my
friend let me know, were not considered beautiful
at all.</p>

<p>He even suggested that he show me something
in contrast with all I had seen. I told him no, that
it would spoil my whole viewpoint.</p>

<p>It has been rather a restful experience, going
through the whole town without being recognised,
but even as I am thinking it a fashionable lady and
her young daughter pass, and by their smiles I
know that I am again discovered.</p>

<p>And then we meet Fritz Kreisler and his wife,
who are just leaving for Munich. We have quite
a chat and then make tentative engagements to be
carried out in Los Angeles on his next trip there.</p>

<p>I notice that the Germans seem to be scrupulously
honest, or maybe this was all the more noticeable
to me because of genial and unsuspicious treatment
by a taxi driver. We left the cab many times
and were gone as long as half an hour at a time,
and out of sight, yet he always waited and never
suggested that he be paid beforehand.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span></p>

<p>In the business section we pass many cripples
with embittered, sullen looks on their faces. They
look as though they had paid for something which
they hadn't received.</p>

<p>We are approached by a legless soldier beggar in
a faded German uniform. Here was the War's
mark. These sights you will find on every side in
Berlin.</p>

<p>I am presented with a police card to the Berliner
Club, which is evidently a technicality by which
the law is circumvented. Berlin is full of such
night-life clubs. They are somewhat like the
gatherings that Prohibition has brought to America.</p>

<p>There are no signs, however, from the outside of
any activity, and you are compelled to go up dark
passages and suddenly come upon gaily lit rooms
very similar to Parisian cafés.</p>

<p>Dancing and popping corks are the first impression
as I enter. We are taken in hand by two girls
and they order drinks for us. The girls are very
nervous. In fact, the whole night-life of this town
seems to be nervous, neurotic, over-done.</p>

<p>The girls dance, but very badly. They do not
seem to enjoy it and treat it as part of the job. They
are very much interested in my friend, who seems
to have the money for the party. On these occasions
my secretary always carries the family roll,
and they are paying much attention to him.</p>

<p>I sit here rather moody and quiet, though one of
the girls works hard to cheer me up. I hear her
asking Robinson what is the matter with me. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
smile and become courteous. But, her duty done,
she turns again to Robinson.</p>

<p>I am piqued. Where is that personality of
mine? I have been told many times that I have
it. But here it is convincingly shown that personality
has no chance against "pursenality."</p>

<p>But I am beginning to get so much attention
from my friends that one of the girls is noticing me.
She senses that I am some one important, but she
can't quite make it out.</p>

<p>"Who is this guy, an English diplomat?" she
whispers to Robinson. He whispers back that I
am a man of considerable importance in the diplomatic
service. I smile benevolently and they become
more interested.</p>

<p>I am treating her rather paternally and am feeling
philosophical. I ask about her life. What is
she doing with it? What ambitions? She is a
great reader, she tells me, and likes Schopenhauer
and Nietzsche. But she shrugs her shoulders in an
indifferent and tragic manner and says, "What
does it matter about life?"</p>

<p>"You make it what it is," she says. "In your
brain alone it exists and effort is only necessary for
physical comfort." We are becoming closer friends
as she tells me this.</p>

<p>But she must have some objective, there must
be some dreams of the future still alive within her.
I am very anxious to know what she really thinks.</p>

<p>I ask her about the defeat of Germany. She
becomes discreet at once. Blames it on the Kaiser.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
She hates war and militarism. That's all I can get
out of her, and it is getting late and we must leave.
Her future intrigues me, but does not seem to
worry her.</p>

<p>On the way home we step in at Kaufman's
apartment and have quite a chat about pictures and
things back in Los Angeles. Los Angeles seems
very far away.</p>

<p>I am invited to a formal dinner party for the
next evening at the home of Herr Werthauer, one
of the most prominent lawyers in all Europe and a
chief of the Kaiser during the war. The occasion
for the dinner was to celebrate the announcement
of Werthauer's engagement to his third wife.</p>

<p>His is a wonderful home in the finest section of
Berlin. At the party there are a number of his
personal friends, Pola Negri, Al Kaufman, Mrs.
Kaufman, Robinson, and myself.</p>

<p>There is a Russian band playing native music all
through the dinner and jazz music is also being dispensed
by two orchestras made up of American
doughboys who have been discharged, but have
stayed on in Germany.</p>

<p>For no reason at all, I think of the story of Rasputin.
This seems the sort of house for elaborate
murders. Perhaps it is the Russian music that is
having this effect on me. There is a huge marble
staircase whose cold austereness suggests all sorts
of things designed to send chills up the spine. The
servants are so impressive and the meal such a ceremony
that I feel that I am in a palace. The Russian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
folk-songs that are being dreamily whined
from the strings of their peculiar instruments have
a very weird effect and I find food and dining the
least interesting things here.</p>

<p>There is a touch of mystery, of the exotic, something
so foreign though intangible, that I find myself
searching everything and everybody, trying to
delve deeper into this atmosphere.</p>

<p>We are all introduced, but there are too many
people for me to try to remember names. There
are herrs, fräuleins, and fraus galore, and I find it
hard to keep even their sex salutations correct.
Some one is making a long, formal speech in
German, and everybody is watching him
attentively.</p>

<p>The host arises and offers a toast to his bride-to-be.
Everyone rises and drinks to their happiness.
The party is very formal and I can make
nothing from the talk going on all about me. The
host is talking and then all get up again with their
glasses. Why, I don't know, but I get up with
them.</p>

<p>At this there is general laughter, and I wonder
what calamity has befallen me. I wonder if my
clothes are all right.</p>

<p>Then I understand. The host is about to toast
me. He does it in very bad English, though his
gestures and tone make it most graceful. He is
inclined to be somewhat pedantic and whenever he
cannot think of the proper English word he uses its
German equivalent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span></p>

<p>As the various courses come the toasts are many.
I am always about two bites late in getting to my
feet with my glass. After I have been toasted
about four times, Mrs. Kaufman leans over and
whispers, "You should toast back again to the
host and say something nice about his bride-to-be."</p>

<p>I am almost gagged with the stage fright that
grips me. It is the custom to toast back to the host
and here I have been gulping down all kinds of
toasts without a word. And he had been sitting
there waiting for me.</p>

<p>I rise and hesitate. "Mr.&mdash;"</p>

<p>I feel a kick on the shins and I hear Mrs. Kaufman
whisper hoarsely:</p>

<p>"Herr."</p>

<p>I think she means the bride-to-be. "Mrs.&mdash;"
No, she isn't that yet. Heavens! this is terrible.</p>

<p>I plunge in fast and furious. "My very best
respects to your future wife." As I speak I look
at a young girl at the head of the table whom I
thought was the lucky woman. I am all wrong.
I sit, conscious of some horrible mistake.</p>

<p>He bows and thanks me. Mrs. Kaufman scowls
and says: "That's not the woman. It's the one
on the other side."</p>

<p>I have a suppressed convulsion and almost die,
and as she points out the real bride-to-be I find
myself laughing hysterically into my soup. Rita
Kaufman is laughing with me. Thank heaven for
a sense of humour.</p>

<p>I am so weak and nervous that I am almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
tempted to leave at once. The bride-to-be is
reaching for her glass to return my salute, though
unless she thinks I am cross-eyed I don't see how
she knows I said anything nice to her.</p>

<p>But she gets no chance to speak. There is
launched a long-winded pedantic speech from the
host, who says that on such rare occasions as this
it is customary to uncork the best in the cellar. This
point gets over in great shape and everybody is
smiling.</p>

<p>I even feel myself growing radiant. I was under
the impression that the best had already been
served. Didn't know he was holding back anything.
With the promise of better wine I am
tempted to try another toast to the bride-to-be.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span></p>

<h2>XIII.<br />
<br />
I FLY FROM PARIS TO LONDON</h2>

<p class="p2">The first night in Paris after our return from
Germany we dined at Pioccardi's, then
walked up to the arches of the old gates of
Paris. Our intention was to visit the Louvre and
see the statue of Venus de Milo, but it only got as
far as intention.</p>

<p>We drifted into the Montmartre district and
stopped in Le Rat Mort, one of its most famous
restaurants. As it is very early in the evening,
there are very few people about&mdash;one reason why
I picked out this place, which later in the night
becomes the centre of hectic revelry.</p>

<p>Passing our table is a striking-looking girl with
bobbed blond hair, shadowing beautiful, delicate
features of pale coloring and soft, strange eyes of a
violet blue. Her passing is momentary, but she
is the most striking-looking girl I have seen in
Europe.</p>

<p>Although there are but few people here, I am
soon recognised. The French are so demonstrative.
They wave, "Hello, Charlot!"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span></p>

<p>I am indifferent. I smile mechanically. I am
tired. I shall go to bed early. I order
champagne.</p>

<p>The bobbed-hair one is sitting at a table near us.
She interests me. But she doesn't turn so that I
can see her face. She is sitting facing her friend,
a dark, Spanish-looking girl.</p>

<p>I wish she'd turn. She has a beautiful profile,
but I would like to see her full face again. She
looked so lovely when she passed me before. I
recall that ghost of a smile that hovered near her
mouth, showing just a bit of beautiful, even, white
teeth.</p>

<p>The orchestra is starting and dancers are swinging
on to the floor. The two girls rise and join the
dance. I will watch closely now and perhaps get
another flash at her when she whirls by.</p>

<p>There is something refined and distinguished
about the little girl. She is different. Doesn't
belong here. I am watching her very closely,
though she has never once looked my way. I like
this touch of the unusual in Montmartre. Still she
may be just clever.</p>

<p>She is passing me in the dance and I get a full
view of her face. One of real beauty, with a sensitive
mouth, smiling at her friend and giving a
complete view of the beautiful teeth. Her face is
most expressive. The music stops and they sit at
their table.</p>

<p>I notice that there is nothing on their table. They
are not drinking. This is strange, here. Nor are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
there sandwiches or coffee. I wonder who they
are. That girl is somebody. I know it.</p>

<p>She gets up as the orchestra plays a few strains
of a plaintive Russian thing. She is singing the
song. Fascinating! An artist! Why is she here?
I must know her.</p>

<p>The song itself is plaintive, elemental, with the
insinuating nuances that are vital to Russian music.
The orchestra, with the violins and 'cellos predominant,
is playing hauntingly, weaving a foreign
exotic spell.</p>

<p>She has poise, grace, and is compelling attention
even in this place. There comes a bit of melancholy
in the song and she sings it as one possessed,
giving it drama, pathos. Suddenly there is a
change. The music leaps to wild abandon. She
is with it. She tosses her head like a wild
Hungarian gipsy and gives fire to every note.
But almost as it began, the abandon is over.
With wistful sweetness, she is singing plaintively
again.</p>

<p>She is touching every human emotion in her song.
At times she is tossing away care, then gently wooing,
an elusive strain that is almost fairylike, that
crescendos into tragedy, going into a crashing
climax that diminishes into an ending, searching
yearning, and wistfully sad.</p>

<p>Her personality is written into every mood of the
song. She is at once fine, courageous, pathetic,
and wild. She finished to an applause that reflected
the indifference of the place. In spots it was spontaneous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
and insistent. In others little attention was
paid to her. She is wasted here.</p>

<p>But she cares not. In her face you can see that
she gets her applause in the song itself. It was
glorious, just to be singing with heart, soul and
voice. She smiles faintly, then sits down modestly.</p>

<p>I knew it. She is Russian. She has everything
to suggest it. Full of temperament, talent
and real emotional ability, hidden away here in Le
Rat Mort. What a sensation she would be in
America with a little advertising! This is just a
thought, but all sorts of schemes present themselves
to me.</p>

<p>I can see her in "The Follies" with superb
dressing and doing just the song she had done then.
I did not understand a word of it, but I felt every
syllable. Art is universal and needs no language.
She has everything from gentleness to passion and
a startling beauty. I am applauding too much, but
she looks and smiles, so I am repaid.</p>

<p>They dance again, and while they are gone I
call the waiter and have him explain to the manager
that I would like to be presented to her. The
manager introduces her and I invite her to my table.
She sits there with us, while her companion, the
dark girl, does a solo dance.</p>

<p>She talks charmingly and without restraint. She
speaks three languages&mdash;Russian, French, and
English. Her father was a Russian general during
the Tsar's reign. I can see now where she gets
her imperious carriage.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span></p>

<p>"Are you a Bolshevik?"</p>

<p>She flushes as I ask it, and her lips pout prettily
as she struggles with English. She seems all
afire.</p>

<p>"No, they are wicked. Bolshevik man, he's
very bad." Her eyes flash as she speaks.</p>

<p>"Then you are bourgeoisie?"</p>

<p>"No, but not a Bolshevik." Her voice suggests
a tremendous vitality, though her vocabulary
is limited. "Bolshevik good idea for the mind,
but not for practice."</p>

<p>"Has it had a fair opportunity?" I ask her.</p>

<p>"Plenty. My father, my mother, my brother
all in Russia and very poor. Mother is Bolshevik,
father bourgeoisie. Bolshevik man very impudent
to me. I want to kill him. He insult me. What
can I do? I escape. Bolshevik good idea, but
no good for life."</p>

<p>"What of Lenin?"</p>

<p>"Very clever man. He tried hard for Bolshevik&mdash;but
no good for everybody&mdash;just in the head."</p>

<p>I learn that she was educated in a convent and
that she had lost all trace of her people. She earns
her living singing here. She has been to the
movies, but has never seen me. She "is go first
chance because I am nice man."</p>

<p>I ask her if she would like to go into moving pictures.
Her eyes light up.</p>

<p>"If I get opportunity I know I make success.
But"&mdash;she curls her mouth prettily&mdash;"it's difficult
to get opportunity."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span></p>

<p>She is just twenty years old and has been in the
café for two weeks, coming there from Turkey, to
which country she fled following her escape from
Russia.</p>

<p>I explain that she must have photographic tests
made and that I will try to get her a position in
America. She puts everything into her eyes as she
thanks me. She looks like a combination of Mary
Pickford and Pola Negri plus her own distinctive
beauty and personality. Her name is "Skaya."
I write her full name and address in my book and
promise to do all I can for her. And I mean to.
We say "Good Night," and she says she feels
that I will do what I say. How has she kept
hidden?</p>

<p>Due at Sir Philip Sassoon's for a garden party
the next day, I decide to go there in an aeroplane
and I leave the Le Bourget aerodrome in Paris in a
plane of La Compagnie des Messageries Aériennes,
and at special request the pilot landed me at
Lympne in Kent and I thereby avoided the crowd
that would have been on hand in London.</p>

<p>It was quite thrilling and I felt that I made a very
effective entrance to the party.</p>

<p>And what a delightful retreat! All the charm of
an English country home, and Sir Philip is a perfect
host. I get English food and treatment. I have
a perfect rest, with no duties, and entertainment as
I desire it. A day and a half that are most pleasant!</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="i_194" id="i_194"></a>
<img src="images/i_194.jpg" width="355" height="550" alt="" />
<p class="caption">I meet Lady Rocksavage and Sir Philip Sassoon.</p>
</div>

<p>Next day there is to be a ceremonial in the schoolhouse,
when a memorial is to be unveiled. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
in honour of the boys of the town who had fallen.
There are mothers, fathers, and many old people,
some of them old in years, others aged by the trials
of the war.</p>

<p>The simple affair is most impressive and the
streets are crowded on our way. I was to blame
for an unhappy contrast. Outside people were
shouting, "Hooray for Charlie!" while inside
souls were hushed in grief.</p>

<p>Such a discordant note. I wished I had not been
so prominent. I wanted everyone to bow in respect
to these dead. The crowds did not belong outside.</p>

<p>And inside, on the little children's faces, I could
see conflicting emotions. There is the reverence for
the dead and yet there is eagerness as they steal
glances at me. I wish I hadn't come. I feel that
I am the disturbing element.</p>

<p>From the school Sir Philip and I went to the
Star and Garter Hospital for wounded soldiers.
Sheer tragedy was here.</p>

<p>Young men suffering from spinal wounds, some
of them with legs withered, some suffering from
shell shock. No hope for them, yet they smiled.</p>

<p>There was one whose hands were all twisted
and he was painting signs with a brush held between
his teeth. I looked at the signs. They were
mottoes: "Never Say Die," "Are We Downhearted?"
A superman.</p>

<p>Here is a lad who must take an anæsthetic whenever
his nails are cut because of his twisted limbs.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
And he is smiling and to all appearances happy.
The capacity that God gives for suffering is so
tremendous, I marvel at their endurance.</p>

<p>I inquire about food and general conditions. They
suggest that the food could be better. This is
attended to.</p>

<p>We are received politely and with smiles from
the crippled lads who are crippled in flesh only.
Their spirit is boisterous. I feel a puny atom as
they shout, "Good luck to you, Charlie."</p>

<p>I can't talk. There is nothing for me to say. I
merely smile and nod and shake hands whenever
this is possible. I sign autographs for as many as
ask and I ask them to give me their autographs. I
honestly want them.</p>

<p>One jovially says, "Sure, and Bill will give you
one too." There is an uproar of laughter and Bill
laughs just as loud as the rest. Bill has no
arms.</p>

<p>But he bests them. He will sign at that. And
he does. With his teeth. Such is their spirit.
What is to become of them? That is up to you and
me.</p>

<p>Back to Sir Philip's, very tired and depressed.
We dine late and I go to my room and read
Waldo Frank's "Dark Mothers." The next
day there is tennis and music and in the evening I
leave for London, where I am to meet H. G.
Wells and go with him to his country home.</p>

<p>I am looking forward to this Saturday, Sunday,
and Monday as an intellectual holiday. I meet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
H. G. at Whitehall and he is driving his own car.
He is a very good chauffeur, too.</p>

<p>We talk politics and discuss the Irish settlement
and I tell him of my trip to Germany. That leads
to a discussion of the depreciation in the value of
the mark. What will be the outcome? Wells
thinks financial collapse. He thinks that marks
issued as they are in Germany will be worthless.</p>

<p>I am feeling more intimate and closer to him.
There is no strain in talking, though I am still a bit
self-conscious and find myself watching myself
closely.</p>

<p>We are out in the country, near Lady Warwick's
estate, and H. G. tells me how the beautiful place
is going to seed; that parts of it are being divided
into lots and sold.</p>

<p>The estate, with its live stock, is a show place.
It is breeding time for the deer and from the road
we can hear the stags bellowing. H. G. tells me
they are dangerous at this time of the year.</p>

<p>At the gate of the Wells' estate a young lad of ten
greets us with a jovial twinkling of the eye and a
brisk manner. There is no mistaking him. He is
H. G.'s son. There is the same moulding of the
structure and the same rounded face and eyes.
H. G. must have looked that way at his age.</p>

<p>"Hello, dad," as he jumps on the running
board.</p>

<p>"This is Charlie," H. G. introduces me.</p>

<p>He takes my grip. "How do?" and I notice
what a fine boy he is.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Wells is a charming little lady with keen,
soft eyes that are always smiling and apparently
searching and seeking something. A real gentlewoman,
soft voiced, also with humorous lines playing
around her mouth.</p>

<p>Everyone seems busy taking me into the house,
and once there H. G. takes me all over it, to my
room, the dining-room, the sitting-room and, an
extra privilege, to his study. "My workshop,"
he calls it.</p>

<p>"Here's where the great events in the history
of the world took place?"</p>

<p>He smiles and says "yes." The "Outline of
History" was born here.</p>

<p>The room is not yet finished, and it is being
decorated around the fireplace by paintings made
by himself and wife. "I paint a bit," he explains.
There is also some tapestry woven by his mother.</p>

<p>"Here is a place if you want to escape when
the strain is too much for you. Come here and
relax."</p>

<p>I felt that this was his greatest hospitality. But I
never used the room. I had a feeling about that,
too.</p>

<p>The study is simple and very spare of furniture.
There is an old-fashioned desk and I get the general
impression of books, but I can remember but one,
the dictionary. Rare observation on my part to
notice nothing but a dictionary, and this was
so huge as it stood on his desk that I couldn't
miss it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span></p>

<p>There is a lovely view from the house of the
countryside, with wide stretches of land and lovely
trees, where deer are roaming around unafraid.</p>

<p>Mrs. Wells is getting lunch and we have it outdoors.
Junior is there, the boy&mdash;I call him that
already. Their conversation is rapid, flippant.
Father and son have a profound analytical discussion
about the sting of a wasp as one of the insects
buzzed around the table.</p>

<p>It is a bit strange to me and I cannot get into
the spirit of it, though it is very funny. I just watch
and smile. Junior is very witty. He tops his
father with jokes, but I sense the fact that H. G.
is playing up to him. There is a twinkle in H. G.'s
eye. He is proud of his boy. He should be.</p>

<p>After lunch we walk about the grounds and I
doze most of the afternoon in the summer-house.
They leave me alone and I have my nap out.</p>

<p>A number of friends arrive later in the evening
and we are introduced all around. Most of these
are literary, and the discussion is learned. St.
John Ervine, the dramatist and author of "John
Ferguson," came in later in the evening.</p>

<p>Ervine discusses the possibility of synchronising
the voice with motion pictures. He is very much
interested. I explain that I don't think the voice is
necessary, that it spoils the art as much as painting
statuary. I would as soon rouge marble cheeks.
Pictures are pantomimic art. We might as well
have the stage. There would be nothing left to the
imagination.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span></p>

<p>Another son comes in. He is more like his
mother. We all decide to play charades and I am
selected as one of the actors. I play Orlando, the
wrestler, getting a lot of fun through using a
coal hod as a helmet. Then Noah's Ark, with
Junior imitating the different animals going into the
ark, using walking sticks as horns for a stag, and
putting a hat on the end of the stick for a camel, and
making elephants and many other animals through
adroit, quick changes. I played old Noah and
opened an umbrella and looked at the sky. Then
I went into the ark and they guessed.</p>

<p>Then H. G. Wells did a clog dance, and did it
very well. We talked far into the night, and I
marvelled at Wells's vitality. We played many
mental guessing games and Junior took all the
honours.</p>

<p>I was awakened next morning by a chorus outside
my door: "We want Charlie Chaplin."
This was repeated many times. They had been
waiting breakfast half an hour for me.</p>

<p>After breakfast we played a new game of H. G.'s
own invention. Everyone was in it and we played
it in the barn. It was a combination of handball
and tennis, with rules made by H. G. Very exciting
and good fun.</p>

<p>Then a walk to Lady Warwick's estate. As I
walk I recall how dramatic it had sounded last night
as I was in bed to hear the stags bellowing, evidently
their cry of battle.</p>

<p>The castle, with beautiful gardens going to seed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
seemed very sad, yet its ruins assumed a beauty
for me. I liked it better that way. Ruins are
majestic.</p>

<p>H. G. explains that everyone about is land poor.
It takes on a fantastic beauty for me, this cultivation
of centuries now going to seed, beautiful in its very
tragedy.</p>

<p>Home for tea, and in the evening I teach them
baseball. Here is my one chance to shine. It is
funny to see H. G. try to throw a curve and being
caught at first base after hitting a grounder to the
pitcher. H. G. pitched, and his son caught. As
a baseball player H. G. is a great writer. Dinner
that night is perfect, made more enjoyable for our
strenuous exercise. As I retire that night I think
of what a wonderful holiday I am having.</p>

<p>Next day I must leave at 2.30 p.m., but in the
morning H. G. and I take a walk and visit an old
country church built in the eleventh century. A
man is working on a tomb-stone in the churchyard,
engraving an epitaph.</p>

<p>H. G. points out the influence of the different
lords of the manor on the art changes of different
periods. Here the families of Lady Warwick
and other notable people are buried. The tombstones
show the influence of the sculpture of all
periods.</p>

<p>We go to the top of the church and view the
surrounding country and then back home for lunch.
My things are all packed and H. G. and his son
see me off. H. G. reminds me not to forget
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
another engagement to dine with him and Chaliapin,
the famous Russian baritone.</p>

<p>As I speed into town I am wondering if Wells
wants to know me or whether he wants me to know
him. I am certain that now I have met Wells,
really met him, more than I've met anyone in
Europe. It's so worth while.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span></p>

<h2>XIV.<br />
<br />
FAREWELLS TO PARIS AND LONDON</h2>

<p class="p2">I had promised to attend the <i>première</i> showing
of "The Kid" in Paris, and I went back to
the French capital as I came, via aeroplane.
The trip was uneventful, and on landing and going
to my hotel I find a message from Doug Fairbanks.
He and Mary had arrived in Paris and were
stopping at the Crillon. They asked me over for
a chat but I was too tired. Doug promised to
attend the <i>première</i> at the Trocadero Theatre.</p>

<p>During the afternoon there came 250 souvenir
programmes to be autographed. These were to be
sold that night for 100 francs each.</p>

<p>In the evening I went to the theatre <i>via</i> the back
way, but there was no escape. It was the biggest
demonstration I had yet seen. For several blocks
around the crowds were jammed in the streets and
the gendarmes had their hands full.</p>

<p>Paris had declared a holiday for this occasion,
and as the proceeds of the entertainment were to
be given to the fund for devastated France the élite
of the country were there. I am introduced to
Ambassador Herrick, then shown to my box and
introduced to the Ministers of the French Cabinet.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span></p>

<p>I do not attempt to remember names, but the
following list has been preserved for me by my
secretary:</p>

<p>M. Menard, who attended on behalf of President
Millerand; M. Jusserand, M. Herbette,
M. Careron, M. Loucheur, Minister of the
Liberated Regions; M. Hermite, Col. and Mrs.
H. H. Harjes, Miss Hope Harjes, Mr. and Mrs.
Ridgeley Carter, Mrs. Arthur James, Mrs. W. K.
Vanderbilt, Mrs. Rutherford Stuyvesant, Walter
Berry, M. de Errazu, Marquis de Vallambrosa,
Mlle. Cecile Sorel, Robert Hostetter, M. Byron-Kuhn,
Mr. and Mrs. Charles G. Loeb, Florence
O'Neill, M. Henri Lettelier, M. Georges Carpentier,
Paul C. Otey, Mr. and Mrs. George Kenneth
End, Prince George of Greece, Princess Xenia,
Prince Christopher, Lady Sarah Wilson, Mrs.
Elsa Maxwell, Princess Sutzo, Vice-Admiral and
Mrs. Albert P. Niblack, Comte and Comtesse
Cardelli, Duchess de Talleyrand, Col. and Mrs.
N. D. Jay, Col. Bunau Varila, Marquise de
Talleyrand-Périgord, Marquis and Marquise de
Chambrun, Miss Viola Cross, Miss Elsie De Wolf,
Marquis and Marquise de Dampierre, and Mr.
and Mrs. Theodore Rousseau.</p>

<p>My box is draped with American and British
flags, and the applause is so insistent that I find
I am embarrassed. But there is a delicious tingle
to it and I am feeling now what Doug felt when
his "Three Musketeers" was shown. The programmes
which I autographed during the afternoon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
are sold immediately and the audience wants more.
I autograph as many more as possible.</p>

<p>I am photographed many times and I sit in a daze
through most of it, at one time going back stage,
though I don't know why, except that I was
photoed back there too.</p>

<p>The picture was shown, but I did not see much
of it. There was too much to be seen in that
audience.</p>

<p>At the end of the picture there came a messenger
from the Minister:</p>

<p>"Would I come to his box and be decorated?"
I almost fell out of my box.</p>

<p>I grew sick. What would I say? There was no
chance to prepare. I had visions of the all-night
preparation for my speech in Southampton. This
would be infinitely worse. I couldn't even think
clearly. Why do I pick out stunts like that? I
might have known that something would happen.</p>

<p>But the floor would not open up for me to sink
through and there was no one in this friendly
audience who could help in my dilemma, and the
messenger was waiting politely, though I imagined
just a bit impatiently, so, summoning what courage
I had, I went to the box with about the same feeling
as a man approaching the guillotine.</p>

<p>I am presented to everybody. He makes a
speech. It is translated for me, but very badly.
While he was speaking I tried to think of something
neat and appropriate, but all my thoughts
seemed trite. I finally realised that he was finished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
and I merely said "<i>Merci</i>," which, after all, was
about as good as I could have done.</p>

<p>And believe me, I meant "<i>Merci</i>" both in
French and in English.</p>

<p>But the applause is continuing. I must say
something, so I stand up in the box and make a
speech about the motion-picture industry and tell
them that it is a privilege for us to make a presentation
for such a cause as that of devastated France.</p>

<p>Somehow they liked it, or made me believe they
did. There was a tremendous demonstration and
several bearded men kissed me before I could get
out. But I was blocked in and the crowd wouldn't
leave. At last the lights were turned out, but still
they lingered. Then there came an old watchman
who said he could take us through an unknown
passage that led to the street.</p>

<p>We followed him and managed to escape, though
there was still a tremendous crowd to break
through in the street. Outside I meet Cami, who
congratulates me, and together we go to the Hotel
Crillon to see Doug and Mary.</p>

<p>Mary and Doug are very kind in congratulating
me, and I tell them of my terrible conduct during
the presentation of the decoration. I knew that I
was wholly inadequate for the occasion. I keep
mumbling of my <i>faux pas</i> and they try to make me
forget my misery by telling me that General
Pershing is in the next room.</p>

<p>I'll bet the general never went through a battle
like the one I passed through that night.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span></p>

<p>Then they wanted to see the decoration, which
reminded me that I had not yet looked at it myself.
So I unrolled the parchment and Doug read aloud
the magic words from the Minister of Instruction of
the Public and Beaux Arts which made Charles
Chaplin, dramatist, artist, an <i>Officier de L'instruction
Publique</i>.</p>

<p>We sit there until three in the morning, discussing
it, and then I go back to my hotel tired but rather
happy. That night was worth all the trip to
Europe.</p>

<p>At the hotel there was a note from Skaya. She
had been to the theatre to see the picture. She
sat in the gallery and saw "The Kid," taking
time off from her work.</p>

<p>Her note:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"I saw picture. You are a grand man. My heart
is joy. You must be happy. I laugh&mdash;I cry.</p>

<p class="left45">
"<span class="smcap">Skaya.</span>"</p>
</div>

<p>This little message was not the least of my
pleasures that night.</p>

<p>Elsie De Wolf was my hostess at luncheon next
day at the Villa Trianon, Versailles, a most
interesting and enjoyable occasion, where I met
some of the foremost poets and artists.</p>

<p>Returning to Paris, I meet Henry Wales, and
we take a trip through the Latin Quarter together.
That night I dine with Cami, Georges Carpentier,
and Henri Letellier. Carpentier asks for an autograph
and I draw him a picture of my hat, shoes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
cane, and moustache, my implements of trade.
Carpentier, not to be outdone, draws for me a huge
fist encased in a boxing glove.</p>

<p>I am due back in England next day to lunch with
Sir Philip Sassoon and to meet Lloyd George.
Lord and Lady Rocksavage, Lady Diana Manners,
and many other prominent people are to be among
the guests, and I am looking forward to the
luncheon eagerly.</p>

<p>We are going back by aeroplane, though Carl
Robinson lets me know that he prefers some other
mode of travel. On this occasion I am nervous and
I say frequently that I feel as though something is
going to happen. This does not make a hit with
Carl.</p>

<p>We figure that by leaving at eight o'clock in the
morning we can make London by one o'clock,
which will give me plenty of time to keep my
engagement.</p>

<p>But we hadn't been up long before we were lost
in the fog over the Channel and were forced to make
a landing on the French coast, causing a delay of
two hours. But we finally made it, though I was
two hours late for my engagement, and the thought
of keeping Lloyd George and those other people
waiting was ghastly.</p>

<p>Our landing in England was made at the Croydon
aerodrome, and there was a big automobile waiting
outside, around which were several hundred people.
The aerodrome officials, assuming that the car was
for me, hustled me into it and it was driven off.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>

<p>But it was not mine, and I found that I was not
being driven to the Ritz, but the Majestic Theatre
in Clapham.</p>

<p>The chauffeur wore a moustache, and, though
he looked familiar, I did not recognise him. But
very dramatically he removed the moustache.</p>

<p>"I am Castleton Knight. A long time ago you
promised me to visit my theatre. I have concluded
that the only way to get you there is to kidnap you.
So kindly consider yourself kidnapped."</p>

<p>I couldn't help but laugh, even as I thought of
Lloyd George, and I assured Mr. Knight that he
was the first one who had ever kidnapped me. So
we went to the theatre, and I stayed an hour and
surprised both myself and the audience by making
a speech.</p>

<p>Back to my hotel Sir Philip meets me and tells me
that Lloyd George couldn't wait, that he had a
most important engagement at four o'clock. I
explained the aeroplane situation to Sir Philip and
he was very kind. I feel that it was most unfortunate,
for it was my only opportunity to meet Lloyd
George in these times, and I love to meet interesting
personages. I would like to meet Lenin,
Trotsky, and the Kaiser.</p>

<p>This is to be my last night in England, and I have
promised to dine and spend the evening with my
Cousin Aubrey. One feels dutiful to one's cousin.</p>

<p>I also discover that this is the day I am to meet
Chaliapin and H. G. Wells. I 'phone H. G. and
explain that this is my last day, and of my promise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
to my cousin. H. G. is very nice. He understands.
You can only do these things with such
people.</p>

<p>My cousin calls for me at dusk in a taxi and we
ride to his home in Bayswater. London is so beautiful
at this hour, when the first lights are being
turned on, and each light to me is symbolical. They
all mean life, and I wish sometimes I could peer
behind all these lighted windows.</p>

<p>Reaching Aubrey's home I notice a number of
people on the other side of the street standing in
the shadows. They must be reporters, I think,
and am slightly annoyed that they should find me
even here. But my cousin explains hesitatingly
that they are just friends of his waiting for a look
at me.</p>

<p>I feel mean and naughty about this, as I recall
that I had requested him not to make a party of my
visit.</p>

<p>I just wanted a family affair, with no visitors,
and these simple souls on the other side of the street
were respecting my wishes. I relent and tell
Aubrey to ask them over, anyway. They are all
quite nice, simple tradesmen, clerks, etc.</p>

<p>Aubrey has a saloon, or at least a hotel, as he
calls it, in the vicinity of Bayswater, and later in
the evening I suggest that we go there and take
his friends with us. Aubrey is shocked.</p>

<p>"No, not around to my place." Then they all
demur. They don't wish to intrude. I like this.
Then I insist. They weaken. He weakens.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span></p>

<p>We enter a bar. The place is doing a
flourishing business. There are a number of pictures
of my brother Syd and myself all over the
walls, in character and straight. The place is
packed to-night. It must be a very popular resort.</p>

<p>"What will you have?" I feel breezy. "Give
the whole saloon a drink."</p>

<p>Aubrey whispers, "Don't let them know you
are here." He says this for me.</p>

<p>But I insist. "Introduce me to all of them." I
must get him more custom.</p>

<p>He starts quietly whispering to some of his very
personal friends: "This is my cousin. Don't say
a word."</p>

<p>I speak up rather loudly. "Give them all a
drink." I feel a bit vulgar to-night. I want to
spend money like a drunken sailor. Even the customers
are shocked. They hardly believe that it's
Charlie Chaplin, who always avoids publicity, acting
in this vulgar way.</p>

<p>I am sure that some of them don't believe despite
many assurances. A stunt of my cousin's. But
they drink, reverently and with reserve, and then
they bid me good night, and we depart quietly,
leaving Bayswater as respectable as ever.</p>

<p>To the house for dinner, after which some one
brings forth an old family album. It is just like all
other family albums.</p>

<p>"This is your great-granduncle and that is your
great-grandmother. This is Aunt Lucy. This one
was a French general."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span></p>

<p>Aubrey says: "You know we have quite a good
family on your father's side." There are pictures
of uncles who are very prosperous cattle ranchers
in South Africa. Wonder why I don't hear from
my prosperous relations.</p>

<p>This is the first time that I am aware of my family
and I am now convinced that we are true aristocrats,
blue blood of the first water.</p>

<p>Aubrey has children, a boy of twelve, whom I
have never met before. A fine boy. I suggest
educating him. We talk of it at length and with
stress. "Let's keep up family tradition. He may
be a member of Parliament or perhaps President.
He's a bright boy."</p>

<p>We dig up all the family and discuss them. The
uncles in Spain. Why, we Chaplins have populated
the earth.</p>

<p>When I came I told Aubrey that I could stay
only two hours, but it is 4 a.m. and we are still
talking. As we leave Aubrey walks with me toward
the Ritz.</p>

<p>We hail a Ford truck on the way and a rather
dandified young Johnny, a former officer, gives us
a lift.</p>

<p>"Right you are. Jump on."</p>

<p>A new element, these dandies driving trucks,
some of them graduates of Cambridge and Oxford,
of good families, most of them, impecunious aristocrats.
Perhaps it is the best thing that could happen
to such families.</p>

<p>This chap is very quiet and gentle. He talks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
mostly of his truck and his marketing, which he
thinks is quite a game. He has been in the grocery
business since the war and has never made so much
money. We get a good bit of his story as we jolt
along in the truck.</p>

<p>He is providing vegetables and fruit for all his
friends in Bayswater, and every morning at four
o'clock he is on his way to the market. He loves
the truck. It is so simple to drive.</p>

<p>"Half a mo." He stops talking and pulls up
for petrol at a pretty little white-tiled petrol station.
The station is all lit up, though it is but 5 a.m.</p>

<p>"Good morning. Give me about five gal."</p>

<p>"Right-o!"</p>

<p>The cheery greeting means more than the simple
words that are said.</p>

<p>The lad recognises me and greets me frankly,
though formally. It seems so strange to me to hear
this truck driver go along conversing in the easiest
possible manner. A truck driver who enjoyed truck
driving.</p>

<p>He spoke of films for just a bit and then discreetly
stopped, thinking, perhaps, that I might not like
to talk about them. And, besides, he liked to talk
about his truck.</p>

<p>He told us how wonderful it was to drive along
in the early morning with only the company of
dawn and the stars. He loved the silent streets,
sleeping London. He was enterprising, full of
hopes and ambitions. Told how he bartered. He
knew how. His was a lovely business.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span></p>

<p>He was smoking a pipe and wore a trilby hat,
with a sort of frock coat, and his neck was wrapped
in a scarf. I figured him to be about thirty years
of age.</p>

<p>I nudged my cousin. Would he accept anything?
We hardly know whether or not to offer it, though
he is going out of his way to drive me to
the Ritz.</p>

<p>He has insisted that it is no trouble, that he can
cut through to Covent Garden. No trouble. I
tell the petrol man to fill it up and I insist on paying
for the petrol.</p>

<p>The lad protests, but I insist.</p>

<p>"That's very nice of you, really. But it was a
pleasure to have you," he says, as he gets back
in his seat.</p>

<p>We cut through to Piccadilly and pull up at the
Ritz in a Ford truck. Quite an arrival.</p>

<p>The lad bids us good-bye. "Delighted to have
met you. Hope you have a bully time. Too bad
you are leaving. Bon voyage. Come back in the
spring. London is charming then. Well, I must
be off. I'm late. Good morning."</p>

<p>We talk him over on the steps as he drives away.
He is the type of an aristocrat that must live. He
is made of the stuff that marks the true aristocrat.
He is an inspiration. He talked just enough, never
too much. The intonation of his voice and his
sense of beauty as he appreciated the dawn stamped
him as of the élite&mdash;the real élite, not the Blue Book
variety.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span></p>

<p>Loving adventure, virtuous, doing something all
the time, and loving the doing. What an example
he is! He has two stores. This is his first truck.
He loves it. He is the first of his kind that I have
met. This is my last night in England. I am glad
that it brought me this contact with real nobility.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span></p>

<h2>XV.<br />
<br />
BON VOYAGE</h2>

<p class="p2">I am off in the morning for Southampton,
miserable and depressed. Crowds&mdash;the
same crowds that saw me come&mdash;are there.
But they seem a bit more desirable. I am leaving
them. There are so many things I wish I had
done. It is pleasant to be getting this applause on
my exit.</p>

<p>I do not doubt its sincerity now. It is just as
fine and as boisterous as it was when I arrived.
They were glad to see me come and are sorry I am
going.</p>

<p>I feel despondent and sad. I want to hug all of
them to me. There is something so wistful about
London, about their kind, gentle appreciation.
They smile tenderly as I look this way, that way,
over there&mdash;on every side it is the same. They
are all my friends and I am leaving them.</p>

<p>Will I sign this? A few excited ones are shoving
autograph books at me, but most of them are
under restraint, almost in repose. They feel the
parting. They sense it, but are sending me away
with a smile.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span></p>

<p>My car is full of friends going with me to Southampton.
They mean little at the moment. The
crowd has me. Old, old friends turn up, friends
that I have been too busy to see. Faithful old
friends who are content just to get a glimpse before
I leave.</p>

<p>There's Freddy Whittaker, an old music-hall
artist with whom I once played. Just acquaintances,
most of them, but they all knew me, and had
all shared, in spirit, my success. All of them are at
the station and all of them understand. They know
that my life has been full every minute I have been
here. There had been so much to do.</p>

<p>They knew and understood, yet they had come
determined just to see me, if only at the door of my
carriage. I feel very sad about them.</p>

<p>The train is about to pull out and everything is
excitement. Everyone seems emotional and there
is a tenseness in the very atmosphere.</p>

<p>"Love to Alf and Amy," many of them
whisper, those who know my manager and his wife.
I tell them that I am coming back, perhaps next
summer. There is applause. "Don't forget,"
they shout. I don't think I could forget.</p>

<p>The trip to Southampton is not enjoyable. There
is a sadness on the train. A sort of embarrassed
sentimentality among my friends. Tom Geraghty
is along. Tom is an old American and he is all
choked up at the thought of my going back while
he has to stay on in England. We are going back
to his land. We cannot talk much.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span></p>

<p>We go to the boat. Sonny is there to see me off.
Sonny, Hetty's brother.</p>

<p>There is luncheon with my friends and there are
crowds of reporters. I can't be annoyed. There is
nothing for me to say. I can't even think. We
talk, small talk, joke talk.</p>

<p>Sonny is very matter-of-fact. I look at him and
wonder if he has ever known. He has always been
so vague with me. Has always met me in a joking
way.</p>

<p>He leans over and whispers, "I thought you
might like this." It is a package. I almost know
without asking that it is a picture of Hetty. I am
amazed. He understood all the time. Was always
alive to the situation. How England covers up her
feelings!</p>

<p>Everybody is off the boat but the passengers.
My friends stand on the dock and wave to me. I
see everything in their glowing faces&mdash;loyalty, love,
sadness, a few tears. There is a lump in my throat.
I smile just as hard as I can to keep them from
seeing. I even smile at the reporters. They're
darn nice fellows. I wish I knew them better.
After all, it's their job to ask questions and they
have been merely doing their job with me. Just
doing their jobs, as they see it. That spirit would
make the world if it were universal.</p>

<p>England never looked more lovely. Why didn't
I go here? Why didn't I do this and that? There
is so much that I missed. I must come back again.
Will they be glad to see me? As glad as I am to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
see them? I hope so. My cheek is damp. I turn
away and blot out the sadness. I am not going to
look back again.</p>

<p>A sweet little girl about eight years of age, full
of laughing childhood, is coming toward me with a
bubbling voice. Her very look commands me not
to try to escape. I don't think I want to escape
from her.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Chaplin," gurgled the little girl,
"I've been looking for you all over the boat.
Please adopt me like you did Jackie Coogan. We
could smash windows together and have lots of
fun. I love your plays."</p>

<p>She takes my hand and looks up into my face.
"They are so clever and beautiful. Won't you
teach me like you taught him? He's so much like
you. Oh, if I could only be like him."</p>

<p>And with a rapt look on her little face she prattles
on, leaving me very few opportunities to get in a
word, though I prefer to listen to her rather than
talk.</p>

<p>I wave good-bye to my friends and then walk
along with her, going up and looking back at the
crowd over the rail.</p>

<p>Reporters are here. They scent something interesting
in my affair with the little girl. I answer
all questions. Then a photographer. We are
photographed together. And the movie men are
getting action pictures. We are looking back at
my friends on shore.</p>

<p>The little girl asks: "Are they all actors and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
the movies? Why are you so sad? Don't you like
leaving England? There will be so many friends
in America to meet you. Why, you should be so
happy because you have friends all over the
world!"</p>

<p>I tell her that it is just the parting&mdash;that the
thought of leaving is always sad. Life is always
"Good-bye." And here I feel it is good-bye to
new friends, that my old ones are in America.</p>

<p>We walk around the deck and she discusses the
merits of my pictures.</p>

<p>"Do you like drama?" I ask.</p>

<p>"No. I like to laugh, but I love to make people
cry myself. It must be nice to act 'cryie' parts,
but I don't like to watch them."</p>

<p>"And you want me to adopt you?"</p>

<p>"Only in the pictures, like Jackie. I would love
to break windows."</p>

<p>She has dark hair and a beautiful profile of the
Spanish type, with a delicately formed nose and a
Cupid's bow sort of mouth. Her eyes are sensitive,
dark and shining, dancing with life and
laughter. As we talk I notice as she gets serious
she grows tender and full of childish love.</p>

<p>"You like smashing windows! You must be
Spanish," I tell her.</p>

<p>"Oh no, not Spanish; I'm Jewish," she
answers.</p>

<p>"That accounts for your genius."</p>

<p>"Oh, do you think Jewish people are clever?"
she asks, eagerly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span></p>

<p>"Of course. All great geniuses had Jewish
blood in them. No, I am not Jewish," as she is
about to put that question, "but I am sure there
must be some somewhere in me. I hope so."</p>

<p>"Oh, I am so glad you think them clever. You
must meet my mother. She's brilliant and an
elocutionist. She recites beautifully, and is so
clever at anything. And I am sure you would like
my father. He loves me so much and I think he
admires me some, too."</p>

<p>She chatters on as we walk around. Then suddenly.
"You look tired. Please tell me and I
will run away."</p>

<p>As the boat is pulling out her mother comes
toward us and the child introduces us with perfect
formality and without any embarrassment. She is
a fine, cultured person.</p>

<p>"Come along, dear, we must go down to the
second class. We cannot stay here."</p>

<p>I make an appointment to lunch with the little
girl on the day after the morrow, and am already
looking forward to it.</p>

<p>I spend the greater part of the second day in
reading books by Frank Harris, Waldo Frank,
Claude McKay, and Major Douglas's "Economic
Democracy."</p>

<p>The next day I met Miss Taylor, a famous
moving-picture actress of England, and Mr. Hepworth,
who is a director of prominence in Great
Britain. Miss Taylor, though sensitive, shy, and
retiring, has a great bit of charm.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span></p>

<p>They are making their first trip to America, and
we soon become good friends. We discuss the
characteristics of the American people, contrasting
their youthful, frank abruptness with the quiet, shy,
and reserved Britisher.</p>

<p>I find myself running wild as I tell them of this
land. I explain train hold-ups, advertising signs,
Broadway lights, blatant theatres, ticket speculators,
subways, the automat and its big sister, the
cafeteria. It has a great effect on my friends and
at times I almost detect unbelief. I find myself
wanting to show the whole thing to them and to
watch their reactions.</p>

<p>At luncheon next day the little girl is the soul of
the party. We discuss everything from Art to
ambitions. At one moment she is full of musical
laughter, and the next she is excitedly discussing
some happening aboard ship. Her stories are
always interesting. How do children see so much
more than grown-ups?</p>

<p>She has a great time. I must visit her father,
he is so much like me. He has the same temperament,
and is such a great daddy. He is so good to
her. And she rattles on without stopping.</p>

<p>Then again she thinks I may be tired. "Sit
back now." And she puts a pillow behind my head
and bids me rest.</p>

<p>These moments with her make days aboard pass
quickly and pleasantly.</p>

<p>Carl Robinson and I are strolling around the top
deck the next day in an effort to get away from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
everyone, and I notice someone looking up at a
wire running between the funnels of the ship.
Perched on the wire is a little bird, and I am
wondering how it got there and if it had been there
since we left England.</p>

<p>The other watcher notices us. He turns and
smiles. "The little bird must think this is the
promised land."</p>

<p>I knew at once that he was somebody. Those
thoughts belong only to poets. Later in the evening
he joins us at my invitation and I learn
he is Easthope Martin, the composer and pianist.
He had been through the War and it had left its
stamp on this fine, sensitive soul. He had been
gassed. I could not imagine such a man in the
trenches.</p>

<p>He is very frail of body, and as he talks I always
imagine his big soul at the bursting point with a
pent-up yearning.</p>

<p>There is the inevitable concert on the last night
of the voyage. We are off the banks of Newfoundland,
and in the midst of a fog. Fog horns must
be kept blowing at intervals, hence the effect on the
concert, particularly the vocal part, is obvious.</p>

<p>We land at seven in the morning of a very windy
day, and it is eleven before we can get away.
Reporters and camera men fill the air during all
that time, and I am rather glad, because it shows
Miss Taylor and Mr. Hepworth a glimpse of what
America is like. We arrange to meet that night at
Sam Goldwyn's for dinner.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span></p>

<p>Good-byes here are rather joyous, because we
are all getting off in the same land and there will be
an opportunity to see one another again.</p>

<p>My little friend comes to me excitedly and gives
me a present&mdash;a silver stamp box. "I hope that
when you write your first letter you take a stamp
from here and mail it to me. Good-bye."</p>

<p>She shakes hands. We are real lovers and must
be careful. She tells me not to overwork. "Don't
forget to come and see us; you must meet daddy.
Good-bye, Charlie."</p>

<p>She curtsies and is gone. I go to my cabin to
wait until we can land. There is a tiny knock. She
comes in.</p>

<p>"Charlie, I couldn't kiss you out there in front
of all those people. Good-bye, dear. Take care of
yourself." This is real love. She kisses my cheek
and then runs out on deck.</p>

<p>Easthope Martin is with us that night at Goldwyn's
party. He plays one of his own compositions
and holds us spellbound. He is very grateful for
our sincere applause and quite retiring and unassuming,
though he is the hit of the evening.</p>

<p>Following the dinner I carried the English movie
folk on a sight-seeing trip, enjoying their amazement
at the wonders of a New York night.</p>

<p>"What do you think of it?" I asked them.</p>

<p>"Thrilling," says Hepworth. "I like it. There
is something electrical in the air. It is a driving
force. You must do things."</p>

<p>We go to a café, where the élite of New York
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
are gathered, and dance until midnight. I bid them
good-bye, hoping to meet them later when they
come to Los Angeles.</p>

<p>I dine at Max Eastman's the next night and meet
McKay, the negro poet. He is quite handsome, a
full-blooded Jamaican negro not more than twenty-five
years of age. I can readily see why he has been
termed an African prince. He has just that
manner.</p>

<p>I have read a number of his poems. He is a
true aristocrat with the sensitiveness of a poet and
the humour of a philosopher, and quite shy. In
fact, he is rather supersensitive, but with a dignity
and manner that seem to hold him aloof.</p>

<p>There are many other friends there, and we discuss
Max's new book on humour. There is a controversy
whether to call it "Sense of Humour"
or "Psychology of Humour." We talk about my
trip. Claude McKay asks if I met Shaw. "Too
bad," he says. "You would like him and he would
have enjoyed you."</p>

<p>I am interested in Claude. "How do you write
your poetry? Can you make yourself write? Do
you prepare?" I try to discuss his race. "What
is their future? Do they&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He shrugs his shoulders. I realise he is a poet,
an aristocrat.</p>

<p>I dine the next evening with Waldo Frank and
Marguerite Naumberg and we discuss her new
system. She has a school that develops children
along the lines of personality. It is a study in individuality.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
She is struggling alone, but is getting
wonderful results. We talk far into the morning on
everything, including the fourth dimension.</p>

<p>Next day Frank Harris calls and we decide to
take a trip to Sing Sing together. Frank is very
sad and wistful. He is anxious to get away from
New York and devote time to his autobiography
before it is too late. He has so much to say that
he wants to write it while it is keen.</p>

<p>I try to tell him that consciousness of age is a
sign of keenness. That age doesn't bother the
mind.</p>

<p>We discuss George Meredith and a wonderful
book he had written. And then in his age Meredith
had rewritten it. He said it was so much
better rewritten, but he had taken from it all the
red blood. It was old, withered like himself. You
can't see things as they were. Meredith had
become old. Harris says he doesn't want the same
experience.</p>

<p>All this on the way to Sing Sing. Frank is a
wonderful conversationalist. Like his friend Oscar
Wilde. That same charm and brilliancy of wit,
ever ready for argument. What a fund of knowledge
he has. What a biography his should be.
If it is just half as good as Wilde's, it will be
sufficient.</p>

<p>Sing Sing. The big, grey stone buildings seem
to me like an outcry against civilisation. This huge
grey monster with its thousand staring eyes. We
are in the visiting room. Young men in grey shirts.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
Thank God, the hideous stripes are gone. This
is progress, humanity. It is not so stark.</p>

<p>There is a mite of a baby holding her daddy's
hand and playing with his hair as he talks with her
mamma, his wife. Another prisoner holding two
withered hands of an old lady. Mother was written
all over her, though neither said a word. I felt
brutal at witnessing their emotion.</p>

<p>All of them old. Children, widows, mothers&mdash;youth
crossed out of faces by lines of suffering and
life's penalties. Tragedy and sadness, and always
it is in the faces of the women that the suffering is
more plainly written. The men suffer in body&mdash;the
women in soul.</p>

<p>The men look resigned. Their spirit is gone.
What is it that happens behind these grey walls that
kills so completely?</p>

<p>The devotion of the prisoners is almost childish
in its eagerness as they sit with their children, talking
with their wives, here and there a lover with his
sweetheart&mdash;all of them have written a compelling
story in the book of life. But love is in this room,
love unashamed. Why are sinners always loved?
Why do sinners make such wonderful lovers?
Perhaps it is compensation, as they call it. Love is
paged by every eye here.</p>

<p>Children are playing around the floor. Their
laughter is like a benediction. This is another improvement,
this room. There are no longer bars
to separate loved ones. Human nature improves,
but the tragedy remains just as dramatic.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span></p>

<p>The cells where they sleep are old-fashioned,
built by a monster or a maniac. No architect could
do such a thing for human beings. They are built
of hate, ignorance, and stupidity. I understand
they are building a new prison, more sane, with far
more understanding of human needs. Until then
these poor wretches must endure these awful cells.
I'd go mad there.</p>

<p>I notice quite a bit of freedom. A number of
prisoners are strolling around the grounds while
others are at work. The honour system is a great
thing, gives a man a chance to hold self-respect.</p>

<p>They have heard that I am coming, and most of
them seem to know me. I am embarrassed.
What can I say? How can I approach them? I
wave my hand merely. "Hello, folks!"</p>

<p>I decide to discard conversation. Be myself.
Be comic. Cut up. I twist my cane and juggle
my hat. I kick up my leg in back. I am on comic
ground. That's the thing.</p>

<p>No sentiment, no slopping over, no morals&mdash;they
are fed up with that. What is there in common
between us? Our viewpoints are entirely different.
They're in&mdash;I'm out.</p>

<p>They show me a cup presented by Sir Thomas
Lipton, inscribed, "We have all made mistakes."</p>

<p>"How do we know but what some of you
haven't?" I ask, humorously. It makes a hit.
They want me to talk.</p>

<p>"Brother criminals and fellow sinners: Christ
said, 'Let him who is without sin cast the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
stone.' I cannot cast the stone, though I have
compromised and thrown many a pie. But I
cannot cast the first stone." Some got it. Others
never will.</p>

<p>We must be sensible. I am not a hero worshipper
of criminals and bad men. Society must
be protected. We are greater in number than the
criminals and have the upper hand. We must
keep it; but we can at least treat them intelligently,
for, after all, crime is the outcome of society.</p>

<p>The doctor tells me that but a few of them are
criminals from heredity, that the majority had been
forced into crime by circumstances or had committed
it in passion. I notice a lot of evil-looking
men, but also some splendid ones. I earnestly
believe that society can protect itself intelligently,
humanly. I would abolish prisons. Call them
hospitals and treat the prisoners as patients.</p>

<p>It is a problem that I make no pretence of solving.</p>

<p>The death house. It is hideous. A plain, bare
room, rather large and with a white door, not green,
as I have been told. The chair&mdash;a plain wooden
armchair and a single wire coming down over it.
This is an instrument to snuff out life. It is too
simple. It is not even dramatic. Just cold-blooded
and matter of fact.</p>

<p>Some one is telling me how they watch the
prisoner after he is strapped in the chair. Good
God! How can they calmly plan with such
exactness? And they have killed as many as seven
in one day. I must get out.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span></p>

<p>Two men were walking up and down in a bare
yard, one a short man with a pipe in his mouth,
walking briskly, and at his side a warden. The
keeper announces, shortly, "The next for the
chair."</p>

<p>How awful! Looking straight in front of him
and coming toward us, I saw his face. Tragic and
appalling. I will see it for a long time.</p>

<p>We visit the industries. There is something
ironical about their location with the mountains for
a background, but the effect is good, they can get
a sense of freedom. A good system here, with the
wardens tolerant. They seem to understand. I
whisper to one.</p>

<p>"Is Jim Larkin here?" He is in the boot
department, and we go to see him for a moment.
There is a rule against it, but on this occasion the
rule is waived.</p>

<p>Larkin struts up. Large, about six feet two
inches, a fine, strapping Irishman. Introduced, he
talks timidly.</p>

<p>He can't stay, mustn't leave his work. Is happy.
Only worried about his wife and children in Ireland.
Anxious about them, otherwise fit.</p>

<p>There are four more years for him. He seems
deserted even by his party, though there is an
effort being made to have his sentence repealed.
After all, he is no ordinary criminal. Just a political
one.</p>

<p>He asks about my reception in England. "Glad
to meet you, but I must get back."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span></p>

<p>Frank tells him he will help to get his release.
He smiles, grips Frank's hand hard. "Thanks."
Harris tells me he is a cultured man and a fine
writer.</p>

<p>But the prison marked him. The buoyancy and
spirit that must have gone with those Irish eyes are
no more. Those same eyes are now wistful, where
they once were gay. He hasn't been forgotten.
Our visit has helped. There may be a bit of hope
left to him.</p>

<p>We go to the solitary-confinement cell, where
trouble makers are kept.</p>

<p>"This young man tried to escape, got out on
the roof. We went after him," says the warden.</p>

<p>"Yes, it was quite a movie stunt," said the
youngster. He is embarrassed. We try to relieve
it.</p>

<p>"Whatever he's done, he's darn handsome," I
tell the warden. It helps. "Better luck next
time," I tell him. He laughs. "Thanks. Pleased
to meet you, Charlie."</p>

<p>He is just nineteen, handsome and healthy.
What a pity! The greatest tragedy of all. He is
a forger, here with murderers.</p>

<p>We leave and I look back at the prison just once.
Why are prisons and graveyards built in such
beautiful places?</p>

<p>Next day everything is bustling, getting ready
for the trip back to Los Angeles. I sneak out in
the excitement and go to a matinée to see Marie
Doro in "Lilies of the Field," and that night to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
"The Hero," a splendid play. A young actor,
Robert Ames, I believe, gives the finest performance
I have ever seen in America.</p>

<p>We are on the way. I am rushing back with
the swiftness of the Twentieth Century Limited.
There is a wire from my studio manager. "When
will I be back for work?" I wire him that I am
rushing and anxious to get there. There is a brief
stop in Chicago and then we are on again.</p>

<p>And as the train rushes me back I am living again
this vacation of mine. Its every moment now
seems wonderful. The petty annoyances were but
seasoning. I even begin to like reporters. They
are regular fellows, intent on their job.</p>

<p>And going over it all, it has been so worth while
and the job ahead of me looks worth while. If I
can bring smiles to the tired eyes in Kennington
and Whitechapel, if I have absorbed and understood
the virtues and problems of those simpler
people I have met, and if I have gathered the least
bit of inspiration from those greater personages who
were kind to me, then this has been a wonderful trip,
and somehow I am eager to get back to work and
begin paying for it.</p>

<p>I notice a newspaper headline as I write. It tells
of the Conference for Disarmament. Is it
prophetic? Does it mean that War will never stride
through the world again? Is it a gleam of
intelligence coming into the world?</p>

<p>We are arriving at Ogden, Utah, as I write.
There is a telegram asking me to dine with Clare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
Sheridan on my arrival in Los Angeles. The prospect
is most alluring. And that wire, with several
others, convinces me that I am getting home.</p>

<p>I turn again to the newspaper. My holiday is
over. I reflect on disarmament. I wonder what
will be the answer? I hope and am inclined to
believe that it will be for good. Was it Tennyson
who wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i2">When shall all men's good</p>
<p>Be each man's rule, and universal peace</p>
<p>Shine like a shaft of light across the lane,</p>
<p>And like a layer of beams athwart the sea?</p>
</div></div>

<p>What a beautiful thought! Can those who go to
Washington make it more than a thought?</p>

<p>The conductor is calling:</p>

<p>"Los Angeles."</p>

<p>"Bye."</p>
